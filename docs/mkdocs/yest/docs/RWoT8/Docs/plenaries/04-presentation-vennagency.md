# Presentation: Venn Agency

BC Government is looking for ways to update fire codes.

So, idea is to scan and create building in 3-D game space.

People who work in building and are liable for people in building have
to play game to prove they can get out, and get a credential. (This
then gives them insurance discount.)

How do we link this into our own ideas about DIDs and VCs?

And how do we expand this into other sorts of credentials using safety
as the angle in?

## Venn Persistence Engine

This is based on 3-D models of locations which are hosted in virtual
space.
