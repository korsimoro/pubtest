Abstract
========

The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) community has described several
groundbreaking properties that arise from the adoption of its
principles. Governance, as in business and financing structure, is
arguably the most challenging of these properties, [captured
succinctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IcU9w9STAo) by
Shoshana Zuboff as: "Who decides? Who decides who decides?" However,
even though the technology has matured greatly over recent years,
bootstrapping an SSI product within the existing capitalistic market
environment is complicated and has not been achieved at scale within any
functional domain. 

A [RWOT6
paper](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/final-documents/sustainable-commons.md)
explored the challenges to a sustainable commons. In this paper, we
apply the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and
Threats) to identify potential paths to adoption. For example, what are
the general implications of introducing a credential holder into
existing issuer/verifier relationships? Our analysis leads to
cooperative (in the legal sense) governance with focus on the holder
(the wallet) as the key innovation, since issuers and verifiers already
exist. The healthcare industry is used as an example.

Introduction
============

Over the past twenty years there have been a consistent wish that
individuals would be able to control their personal information in a
manner equivalent to the pre-internet age. There have been multiple
"turns of the wheel" (OAuth, SAML) of technological standards that have attempted
to enable this. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the latest attempt to
do so. In each of the previous attempts, the technology and work
that was supposed to strengthen the position of the individual was
subverted and the result is the current situation of strong corporate
players (Google, Facebook) leveraging convenience to further mine
behavioral data on individuals.

There can be no argument that there is a ground swell around SSI
currently; the real unknown is whether SSI will maintain its current
trajectory of empowering the individual to regain control of their
information. However there are still real challenges ahead around
enabling adoption and countering attempts to hijack the sector and
direct it in some unforeseen manner. This paper provides a strategic
analysis (SWOT) of the SSI community and sector to reveal where we
believe the threats may appear and to identify the best path to adoption.

SWOT Analysis
=============

This paper applies the SWOT Analysis, a strategic planning technique
that can help an individual or an organization in determining Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats ("SWOT") to identify possible
paths to adoption around Self-Sovereign Identity concepts. SWOT analysis
may be used in any decision-making situation when a desired end-state
(objective) is known. It should take into account internal and external
factors that contribute to achieving or failing to achieve a given end
result. The results of the SWOT Analysis can inform about possible
measures or counter-measures in order to support or prevent certain
anticipated factors.

Strengths of SSI
----------------

-   Avoids an enterprise sale: adoption can be decentralized, one
doctor, one patient at a time. Separating the SSI strategy in this way avoids having to create both supply & demand (bootstrapping
cost, typical in a platform)

-   Ease of implementing Privacy by Default

-   Transparency is controlled by principals (doctors, patients) not by
intermediaries

-   Non-sectoral: the same personal agent creates opportunities across
industries/sectors

-   No corporate data aggregation

-   Builds on top of object capabilities and delegation framework

-   An Identity-layered Internet allows for the development of new
business models in a privacy-preserving way without expensive
platform intermediaries (decentralized Uber, decentralized eBay,
decentralized AirBnB).

Weaknesses of SSI
-----------------

-  A barrier or friction point in adoption is created by introducing the holder into an incumbent verifier-issuer
relationship.

-   Lack of upfront financing due to lack of platform leverage (chicken
& egg problem)

-   Risk of increasing transaction costs

-   Every technology can be used for good or bad and in many instances
the first 'commercial' successes are for illicit purposes; quacks
and fraudsters, are going to rise, creaing the potential for social media
hysteria and significant shifting of market perception.

-   Correlation of agent endpoint (we need tunnels, Tor, ...)

-   Cellphones, as a secure element, are not inherently SSI

-   Walled garden App Stores are not inherently SSI

Opportunities of SSI
--------------------

-   The value (cost) of data brokers/intermediaries can be redistributed to
the principals (issuer, subject/holder, verifier)

-   Decentralization of policy making promotes diversity and resilience

-   Competition for governance

-   Authorization agent improves data quality: elimination of rekeying,
provenance implicit, streaming, query, single of point of
monitoring, policies stay private

-   Use of Zero-knowledge proofs for reputation, nullification (e.g.,
vote only once), data minimization

-   Globalization of medicine where the patient selects the jurisdiction of
physician; decentralization of reputation and issuance (e.g.,
guilds vs states)

-   AI cost is 80% data and data cleansing, 10% data science and
technology, 10% verification/validation (elimination/reduction of
data brokers does not remove/limit AI)

-   Decentralization of AI to reflect SSI principles through Self-Sovereign AI-enhanced agents based on federated machine learning.
Federated machine learning means that one AI can teach another AI
without actually sharing the training data itself.
Human-in-the-loop AI is another example of Self-Sovereign AI.

-   Standardized data governance labeling
([http://bit.ly/PPR-IGL](http://bit.ly/PPR-IGL)),
*Quinn Grundy et al. - Data sharing practices of medicines related
apps and the mobile ecosystem: traffic, content, and network
analysis, BMJ2019*)

-   Agent capability improves with greater API standardization within
the market (API effectively defines the data model. Semantic
compatibility makes the agent more reliable.)

Threats of SSI
--------------

-   Data brokers and intermediaries will fight to keep their current
roles.

-   Platform mentality and political power of platform, through the
vehicle of regulatory capture, can delay effective standards and
raise regulatory barriers.

-   Need for standards, and lead times for standards.

-   Market inertia: data brokers are here and built into the value
chain.

-   May require governmental action (antitrust for oligopolies/monopolies,
human rights of access and privacy)

-   Requiring change by multiple stakeholder categories (issuer, holder,
verifier) magnifies barriers.

-   Existence of government regulation (NIST-regulated trust framework
models), where stakeholders may be willing to change but
regulatory inertia causes delay.

-   Data brokers are very large businesses, like icebergs, 90% hidden.

-   Crypto wallets that are not SSI get integrated natively into iOS and
Android.

-   Agents as a Service (AaaS) (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Telco's,
ISPs)

-   Intel SGX favors platforms and centralization

-   Elimination of data brokers requires an alternative for all of a
particular data broker's roles. Solutions may be required in as
many as six use cases (reputation, matchmaker, transaction
convenience, data brokerage, mapping data for a common ontology,
and record retention)

-   Lack of business knowledge for tech-first SSI industry participants

-   Collusion or Regulatory Capture: direction is taken over by a
limited number of private corporations that organize in "community
groups", that do not truly represent commons or effectively create
a barrier to entry.

SWOT Result Interpretation: "Barriers, Pathways and the Third Rail" 
=====================================================================

With the identified factors of the SWOT analysis we are able to deduce
further implications around the adoption of SSI. Specifically, we want to
point out possible barriers, pathways, and distractions that may arise.

Barriers
--------

-   Want to bootstrap use without single entity dominance.

-   Non-traditional economic model; SSI model has by definition no
equity upfront. All value is created in the Commons.

-   A Commons does generate enough equity for traditional finance models.

-   Platform tokens have security regulatory risk.

-   Surveillance capitalism has very low friction.

-   Cultural norms (China) resistant to full agency (want backdoors).

-   India (Aadhaar) wants to centralize and maintain control of
identifiers.

Pathway Choices
---------------

### Desired End State

Open-source standards-based code in a cooperative-based financial
model, with each co-op on their specific policies while agreeing to allow
any individual or entity to exit the cooperative, start their own
cooperative, or operate outside of any cooperative. See [Rochdale
Society](https://www.rochdalepioneersmuseum.coop/about-us/the-rochdale-principles/)
and seven principles of cooperatives and [Past, Present, Future: From
Co-ops to
Cryptonetworks](https://a16z.com/2019/03/02/cooperatives-cryptonetworks/).

### Community-driven Wallet reference implementation

Given the novelty and importance of the introduction of holder
responsibility, the community should strive towards providing a
non-commercial wallet implementation to support this process and lower
the barrier to entry.

### AaaS First

Agent as a Service (AaaS) as an intermediate pathway before completely
moving the responsibility of the agent into the User space (e.g., "access
recovery via the centralized service, like people are used to"). However,
these services would need to be tightly regulated and allow a seamless
transition into a fully self-sovereign internet. Regulation should aim
at removing them altogether as soon as a critical size has been reached.

The Third Rail
--------------

-   A megamerger of platforms across hosting, telecom, and payment
creates the universal identity based on transaction surveillance.
Regulating data use instead of regulating aggregation itself is a
prescription for disaster.

-   Apple fails at privacy by default; Facebook privacy theater wins.

-   Private telecom uses 5G to eliminate the opportunity for personal
firewalls as agents. Alternatives, such as mesh networks and free
community broadband, are not actively pursued. (Need regulatory
measures to give control to the owner of 5G-enabled equipment,
e.g. keys, triple-blind, etc.)

-   Our children join corporate America with blind respect for authority
and platforms. The SSI infrastructure need for diverse
holders/subjects is seen as a risk.

-   Private authority does not have the ability to deter bad behavior
the same way that government can, but government is weak compared
to private sector.

The Health Care Example
=======================

Healthcare (the industry) is large and more about personal data than
most markets. Health care (the value transaction) is prone to
decentralization because the principals, patients, and licensed
practitioners are able to transact independent of any institution and
in some cases independent of any particular jurisdiction. This kind of
decentralization is reminiscent of public blockchains.

SSI, in this example, applies to the licensed practitioner as well as
the patient. Each of them is a holder. The practitioner holds
credentials issued by testing institutions and benefits from appropriate
reputation mechanisms tied to their identity. The patient holds health
records, including notes, diagnoses, and prescriptions, issued by the
licensed practitioners. These two rather different holder technologies
must interact with each other independently of institutional issuers and
verifiers.

The healthcare industry is dominated by data broker intermediaries that
aggregate practitioner licenses and reputation on one side and aggregate
patient health records on the other. We call them hospitals. Under what
circumstances would the hospital support the introduction of SSI holders
on behalf of either the practitioners or the patients?

Competitive pressure will force hospitals to accept SSI, effectively
driving them out of the data brokerage business if they wish to remain
in the principal business of operating ERs, surgery suites, and other
health care services. But for that to happen the data brokerage function
of hospitals will need to shift to an SSI model that respects a
diversity of standards-based holders. What institutions will organize
the tech and support systems to provide holders to the practitioners and
patients?

Patient and physician cooperatives could provide governance and support
for SSI holders without need for a proprietary business model or private
equity. Alternative structures for support of SSI holders could be
government (as a public commons) or a not-for-profit collaboration by
interested principals such as pharmaceutical and device manufacturers.
Strategic support could also come from employers and other players that
stand to benefit from reducing the cost of data brokerage in healthcare.
Another possibility for support of SSI would be a new class of data
brokers built around a fiduciary relationship with the subjects. These
Agent as a Service models will pick and choose among the SSI principles
and standards and possibly focus on healthcare to the exclusion of other
markets in order to develop brand and platform economics with private
equity support.

Conclusion
==========

Adoption of SSI is dominated by the challenge to the data brokers and
intermediaries that would be replaced by holder technology. Even if some
data brokers are able to pivot to Agent as a Service during a transition
to SSI, the highly redundant and hidden data aggregation business would
be decimated. SSI can overcome these incumbents while staying true to
its principles by developing and supporting holder technology through a
cooperative model. Cooperatives can focus on the needs of issuers and
verifiers in specific markets while at the same time adopting and
supporting standards that will allow holders to operate seamlessly
across diverse markets. Transitional states on the path to decentralized
SSI could include holder services with a more or less fiduciary
relationship to the subject. In the long-run, self-sovereign identity
and individual agency require both Free software and standards with
support through cooperative governance.

The disintermediation and destruction of current data broker business
models provide very strong economic incentive to hijack and subvert the
goals of the SSI community. This is something that community must be
constantly aware of and be prepared to counter.
