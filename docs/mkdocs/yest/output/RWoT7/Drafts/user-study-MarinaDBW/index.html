<p>Marina Delighted By Web Technology</p>
<p>Authors: Kim Hamilton Duffy, Heather Vescent, Daniel Burnett, and Daniel Pape</p>
<p>Marina is a CMO at a growing startup. Because the company is small, Marina is used to being very hands on. She's become very comfortable using automation and scripting to keep her leads and campaigns in sync, and she loves that she can easily and quickly explore and integrate new data sources.</p>
<p>Marina manages her company's social media accounts, and while she's happy with her favorite social media management tool, she does have concerns that the company's social media data is silod. She's especially concerned about lockin and preserving the company's reputation across different social media platforms.</p>
<p>Marina is an important user to keep in mind as we build the SSI stack. She is a user that's very comfortable with web technologies and perceives a great benefit in the tooling that exists. We need to ensure Marina's experience remains as seemless as she perceives it. Ideally, we can improve her life by addressing her concerns about silod data.</p>
<p>At the same time, convenience of SSI tools is critical. If Marina sees a DID, we have failed.</p>
