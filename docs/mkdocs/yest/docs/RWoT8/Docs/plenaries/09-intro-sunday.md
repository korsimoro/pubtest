# Intro (Our Last Day)

Another freewheeling discussion, leading off our final day.

## The Final Day

Today is when we finish our papers.

Be aware that the last day is when we have our most conflict.

_Listen first and make sure you understand, before you respond._

## How Do We Get More People Involved to Improve Diversity?

Maybe it's not about diversity.

What we want is a broad of expertise and experience.

We want multidisplinery writing and products with a broad range of
perspectives.

Maybe shifting the language to "multidisciplinary" is what's needed.

We also need to do more than just focus on the technical.

We need to go beyond code to laws and ethics.

Suggested that all papers need to include input from non-technical
people: that all collaboration should come from two "different" kinds
of people.

Or it might be sufficient to have paragraph suggesting your purpose in
tech papers, to help put things in context. _Where are we going and
why?_

Another suggestion: have one workshop each year be about technical
stuff and socioeconomic stuff, and other be about those groups coming
together.

Suggestion: _Move slowly and fix things._

The book _Capitalism Realism_ may be analogous to us. It talks about
how we don't look at non-capitalism solutions nowadays because
capitalism is the de facto standard. So we might similarly look at
problems as needing commercial solutions, even in the identity
space. But we also have _technical realism_: we don't always need
technical solutions!

## Next Steps

We need to move our files to Github as MD files.

We need to name team leaders.

And team leaders will need to communicate with Shannon, the
editor-in-chief.
