    <p>At RWOT Boston, we hosted a meeting with Ed Bice of Meedan and the Credibility Indicators Working Group of the IPTC along with Sandro Hawke of W3C and other members and chairs of W3C groups to discuss the application of DID and Verifiable Claims to the problem of fake news. </p>
<p>Christopher Allen, Manu Sporny and Moses Ma facilitated the discussion that was very fruitful. Meedan has a solution called “CHECK” to enable confirmations and add meta-data that could provide the scaffolding for a suction to protecting how truth is expressed. The Verifiable Claim would provide an envelope for that information, and DIDs and other technologies could be used to combat the proliferation of bots that weaponize dis-information.</p>
<p>It was a very lively and interesting discussion, which was graphically recorded to insure continuous context. The group arrived at a number of action items, including the completion of a white paper in a month, which we'll preview at W3C's TPAC conference in San Francisco, November 9-10, 2017. </p>
<p>Let us know if you'd like to volunteer to participate in this initiative!</p>
<p>Future updates on what we've accomplished will be posted to this GitHub.</p>
