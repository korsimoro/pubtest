    <h1 id="day-three-introduction">Day Three Introduction</h1>
<p>This is our last day.</p>
<p>We need content from everyone in the repo, preferably in markdown (MD).
   * Convert with Pandoc</p>
<p>Decide who the lead author is, who the co-authors are, and who the
contributors are.</p>
<p>We'll get all lead author emails by the end of the day, and we'll be
in contact with in the weeks ahead.</p>
<h2 id="international-womens-day">International Women's Day</h2>
<p>Why did we have less female attendees this time than in Boston?</p>
<p>Maybe timing?</p>
<p>Maybe some negative feedback from last time, with women feeling they
couldn't get their perspective across?</p>
<p>For the future, perhaps members could seek out co-authors for their
topic papers that are diverse</p>
<h2 id="iiw">IIW</h2>
<p>A month from now in Mountain View</p>
<p>Discount tickets end tomorrow</p>
<h2 id="getting-people-up-to-speed">Getting People Up to Speed</h2>
<p>Perhaps we need a half-day to get people up to speed on our tech at
our start</p>
<ul>
<li>And perhaps we need someone else to do the teaching</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps we need a few paragraphs on the web site to talk about our
process and <em>what to expect</em></p>
<p>Perhaps we need an illustrated glossary for DID</p>
<ul>
<li>Moses will take it on</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="secondary-focus">Secondary Focus</h2>
<p>We're beginning with our secondary focus.</p>
<p>We have five topics, but you don't have to take on one if you prefer
what you're working on already:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h1 id="1-adhaar-vs-self-sovereign-id-joe">1. Adhaar vs Self-Sovereign ID (Joe)</h1>
</li>

<h1 id="4-minimal-web-of-trust-schema-christopher">4. Minimal Web of Trust Schema (Christopher)</h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cut due to absence:</p>

</ul>
<p>Possible additional topics:</p>

</li>
<li>

</ul>
<h2 id="other-logistics">Other Logistics</h2>
