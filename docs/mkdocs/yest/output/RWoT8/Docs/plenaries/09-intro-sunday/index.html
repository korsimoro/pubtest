    <h1 id="intro-our-last-day">Intro (Our Last Day)</h1>
<p>Another freewheeling discussion, leading off our final day.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-day">The Final Day</h2>
<p>Today is when we finish our papers.</p>
<p>Be aware that the last day is when we have our most conflict.</p>
<p><em>Listen first and make sure you understand, before you respond.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-get-more-people-involved-to-improve-diversity">How Do We Get More People Involved to Improve Diversity?</h2>
<p>Maybe it's not about diversity.</p>
<p>What we want is a broad of expertise and experience.</p>
<p>We want multidisplinery writing and products with a broad range of
perspectives.</p>
<p>Maybe shifting the language to "multidisciplinary" is what's needed.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>We also need to do more than just focus on the technical.</p>
<p>We need to go beyond code to laws and ethics.</p>
<p>Suggested that all papers need to include input from non-technical
people: that all collaboration should come from two "different" kinds
of people.</p>
<p>Or it might be sufficient to have paragraph suggesting your purpose in
tech papers, to help put things in context. <em>Where are we going and
why?</em></p>
<p>Another suggestion: have one workshop each year be about technical
stuff and socioeconomic stuff, and other be about those groups coming
together.</p>
<p>Suggestion: <em>Move slowly and fix things.</em></p>
<p>The book <em>Capitalism Realism</em> may be analogous to us. It talks about
how we don't look at non-capitalism solutions nowadays because
capitalism is the de facto standard. So we might similarly look at
problems as needing commercial solutions, even in the identity
space. But we also have <em>technical realism</em>: we don't always need
technical solutions!</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>We need to move our files to Github as MD files.</p>
<p>We need to name team leaders.</p>
<p>And team leaders will need to communicate with Shannon, the
editor-in-chief.</p>
