I found it amusing to find analogies between how blockchain and how the Universe work. This is a napkin analysis meant for the entertainment only. Probably it has already been done in much more detail. Anyway, I hope it will amuse someone also.

## Blockchain 
1. Ever increasing in size. Had Big Bang.
3. Have a block time 
4. Not editable without impractically massive amount of work
5. Public-private key pairs
6. Have randomness in? 

## Universe
1. Ever expanding. Had genesis block.
2. Have Plank time - smallest possible time period
3. Time is not reversable - not editable 
4. Entanglement phenomenon 
5. Uncertainty principal

Coincidence:) ?

Help me with point 5. Find analogy to the uncertainty principal of the universe to something inherently random in blockchain. Is there any randomness, uncertainty in blockchains?
