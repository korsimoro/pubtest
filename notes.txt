Why Jekyll
  Lots of available plugins - these can be incrementally integrated
  to improve what we can do.  There are clearly a lot of things that
  might be useful, and it is at the heart of a large git-oriented
  user community - e.g. people hosting on github pages.

Combine databases with different schemas

c:\sqlite>sqlite3.exe old_db.sqlite
sqlite> .output mytable_dump.sql
sqlite> .dump my_table
sqlite> .quit
Read the dump into the new_db.sqlite assuming the table there does not exist

c:\sqlite>sqlite3.exe new_db.sqlite
sqlite> .read mytable_dump.sql
