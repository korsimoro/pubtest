    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the largest rebooting we've had, at 90 pre-signups and 69
topic papers.</p>
<p>We do introductions from everyone. We have many people from Europe,
Asia, and North America.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-doing-and-how-to-do-it">What We're Doing and How to Do It</h2>
<p>We are here to write: English writing, other language, or even code.</p>
<p>Some lessons we've learned:
* Seek first to understand, then to integrate. Try to understand
other peoples' weird ideas.<br />
* Use the white space: breaks, dinner. Meet people outside your group
and make new connections.
* When in doubt, write. Debate and have ideas, but flesh things out by
  putting words in.</p>
<h2 id="why-rebooting">Why Rebooting?</h2>
<p>PGP came out 27 years ago.</p>
<p>But it's old and it didn't meet a lot of the goals of the web of trust.</p>
<p>So Christopher Allen asked if we can reboot it.</p>
<p>At first Rebooting the Web of Trust, we said what we can do.</p>
<p>DIDs came out of RWOT, while Verifiable Claims really came to life.</p>
<p>This is the end of our fourth year, and we probably have another four
or five years for this to really take off.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-be-excellent-to-each-other">How to Be Excellent to Each Other</h2>
<p>We are all very passionate, and must be careful not to cross a line.</p>
<p>We have a simple code of conduct: be excellent to each other, be
respectful, listen to each other, try to deescalate any situations.</p>
<p>You can alternatively approach: Andrew, Sam, or Manu if you're
uncomfortable about something.</p>
<p>We just want everyone to be resepected and feel heard.</p>
<p>Also, we want you to be crazy productive, so if you have any problems
with that, let us know.</p>
<h2 id="a-welcome-from-the-catalonia-government">A Welcome from the Catalonia Government</h2>
<p>Catalonia government welcome us.</p>
<p>Is proud to part of the digital revolution because Catalania is a land
of revolutionaries of different sorts.</p>
<p>Welcome, Digital Revolutionaries, to Catalania!</p>
