  <!---layout: collection 
          This layout is for when you place a bunch of html files in a directory 
          and it organized them into pages.
        For and example of collections in action see https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto/discolog/ 
      
        I think this app will enable you to do like you were tryin tho...

<h3>People - Graph</h3>
<pre>
use kumu embed here

<h3>People - Search</h3>
how can we help people find someone - so not just name or initials
searches, but maybe, term searches?


<h3>People - List</h3>
Sometimes raw lists are just the best.
And I have no idea how to get pagination working! ;)

pagination works if you have a blog post /info
.notice--danger

And shouldn't this just be a searchable table... 
<!--That is not my forte'-->

<ul class="inline">
  {% for item in site.data.rwot_people %}
    <li>{{ item.Label }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
