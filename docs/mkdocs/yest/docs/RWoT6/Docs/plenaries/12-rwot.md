# Meta RWOT

## The Next Rebooting the Web of Trust

Toronto, end of September

Other options, some place warm, maybe Europe friendly

Maybe we should be BOFing at other conferences

## Feedback: Plusses & Deltas

### Plusses

   * Intellectually stimulating
   * Topic Papers discussion helped to focus
   * Pushed straight into topics & authors
   * Nice space
      * No caves, good noise
      * Numbering of tables for static locales was good
   * Mandatory minor
      * Even if only contributed for a little bit
   * Sticker triage system
      * Would be nice to write names
   * Recorded sessions
   * Names and abstracts, end of day one
   * We don't administratively prioritize content
   * Nice explanation of primers
   * Do an external webinar on enterprise channel
      * Get corporate support
   * JOE, ERICA
      * Purposefully brought in an additional coordinator
      * Purposefully nurtured space

### Deltas

   * Wifi
      * Own our own router & hot spots      
   * Last-minute topic papers
      * Early Bird Paper Discount
   * Announced too late
   * Not enough focus on allied communities (DIF, etc)
   * Weak signal breakout may not be useful
      * Something that emerges naturally  may be better
      * Or maybe we talk about it on later days
   * Don't support butterflies (bumblebees?) well
      * But maybe we don't want to
   * Networking bumblebees interrupted groups
   * Space a little cramped
   * Needed white boards or sketching, a monitor with a HDMI at each table
      * Paper table cloths? [not as good]
   * Would prefer speed-dating for proposals
   * Need more introductions for first timers (onboarding)
      * Can we leverage decentralized nature with a one-hour video or something?
   * Is three days enough?
   * Be conscious of travel times, and keep it close to a major airport
   * Poor diversity (so: prioritization & outreach)
   * Blurbs for topics beforehand might help selection process
   * Are there too many topic papers to be able to give attention too
   * Need a discussion of how this is different, and WHAT TO EXPECT
      * That is, tell people to read primers and other papers that interest them
   * Webinar for introducing RWOT and the papers
   * No discussion time for primers
      * The roadshow was nice!
   * Everyone goes to newest shiny thing
      * Hurts follow-through
   * Be more obvious about targets beyond RWOT

## Trends

   * Corporations wanting self-sovereign identity, blockchains
      * Sometimes it's just to protect their data from asks
   * Need for new identity systems and better security
   * Need to understand who's funding
   * Crypto/blockchain system is constantly reinventing itself
   * Governments moving to open government and open data systems
   * Increased self-Governance, separate from governments
   * Better key management
   * Blockchain ecosystem is getting lots of money, and they have specific desires
      * This will create more influx of interest in our topics
   * The role of standards is well-considered for RWOT
      * Both standards bodies and shipping standardized products
   * SSI is winning the war
   * Blockchain hype is still through the roof
      * When is the crash?
      * And we should remember that blockchains are just a tool
      * So we shouldn't tie ourselves to blockchains
   * Blockchain observatory
   * Onboarding (in a trusted manner)
   * Convergence of AI & Decentralized products
      * Because blockchains aren't a product for end-users
   * Biometrics
   * Going off the blockchain (with Lightning & various sorts of proofs)
   * Increased visibility & accountability
   * Beneficial ownership: connecting a known person to a regulatory entity

## The Future of RWOT

Part of the agreement on running this conference was figuring out how
to create an organization where the organizers don't have personal
liability.

   * Have looked at many options, including non-profits

Proposal to create a fit-for-purpose LLC whose only job is to run
these workshops and get our stuff published

The idea of bringing people together to create papers is _unique in
the world_, so we want to figure out a way to make it stable.

So we now have a board of five to hold the moral authority of the
community,

We're trying to create trust by how we interact with our community

Maybe we can help encourage volunteerism through sharing if any
profits ever do appear

## Strengths

   * Collaboration, generally
   * Collaboration on _external_ objectives
      * Reasons to be here; being here isn't the objective
      * The reason to be here is collaborative solving
   * We publish
      * We publish great content
   * We are not an online community

## Weaknesses

   * Cat-herding
   * Lack of process
   * Poor process for getting material out
      * Technology pipeline
   * Lack of social media manager
   * Problems with convincing sponsors
      * In relation to other conferences, which we think are less useful
   * Not much discussion of how to move papers onto standard track
   * We are not an online community
   * Modest resources
   * Lack of cryptographers

## Opportunities

   * Being able to continue these discussions, on Slack
   * Better train our community to participate in standards
   * Implementing our ideas & standards
   * Can improve our models of the users
      * Right now, we expect our users to be intentive and thoughtful
   * Do more onboarding of non-developers
   * Could use wireframing
   * Create threats for ourselves (red teaming)
   * Do more hackathons
   * Collated book of content
   * Formation of social media platform using our own accounts
   * Getting support from organizations who are sending members here

## Threats

   * Blind spots
   * Insufficient needs mapping
   * Burn out
   * We deploy something stupid
   * Lack of attention
      * Both externally & internally
   * Competitive sabotage
      * Large companies are undermining our efforts
   * Signal-to-noise ratio in space
      * Awful ICOs clamining they're self-sovereign identity
   * Tragedy of the Commons / Free riders
   * Misrepresenting / Co-opting of our ideas
