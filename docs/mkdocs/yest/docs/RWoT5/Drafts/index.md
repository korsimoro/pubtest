## Potential Outputs, By Topic with Info

**Overview**

   * _Four Primers Update_, led by Joe Andrieu, Natalie Smolenski, Drummond Reed, and Manu Sporney_. Overviews of functional identity, self-sovereign identity, DIDs, and verifiable claims. 

**DIDs**

   * _DID Spec Update_, led by Drummond Reed & Manu Sporny. An update of the spec for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).
   * _DID Method Spec Template Definition_, led by ?. A template for creating DID Method Specs. 
   * _DID Resolver_, led by Markus Sabadello. A program for resolving DIDs using a variety of methods.
   * _IPID Interplanetary Identifiers_, led by Jonathan Holt. DID over IPFs specs.
   * _Veres1 Method Spec_, led by Manu Sporny. DID method spec for Veres One.
   
**Blockcerts**

   * _Blockcerts Revocation with DIDs_, led by Kim Duffy Hamilton. 
   
**Legalities**

   * _Breaking (Down) the Law_, led by Dazza Greenwood. Comparing traditional law structures with cryptographic structures.
   * _GDPR: The Data Apocalypse; or, "A Digital Declaration of Rights"_, led by Marta  Piekarska. How self-sovereign identities and verifiable claims can ease the GDPR in the EU.
   
**Object Capabilities**

   * _Capabilities Built on Linked Data Signatures via Certificate Chaining_, led by Christopher Webber. Layering an object capability model on top of Linked Data Signatures.
   * _Hub Asset Access Control System_, led by Matt Smith. Revision of the Hub system from using ACLs to Object Capabilities.
   * _Identity Hubs Capabilities Perspective_, led by Adrian Gropper. Changing identity hubs from using ACLs to Object Capabilities.

**Selective Disclosure**

   * _Data Minimization & Selective Disclosure_, led by Lionel Wolberg. Definitions of data minimization and disclosure, plus a technical look.

**Signatures**

   * _Smarm: Smart Signatures_, led by Christopher Webber. A Scheme-like smart-signature system.
   
**Social Systems**

   * _ActivityPub_, led by Christopher Webber. Overview of the W3C protocol for developing federated social systems.

**Theory**

   * _The DCS Theory_, led by Greg Slepak. A system cannot be decentralized, consensus, and scalable, simultaneously.
   * _Identity Mental Maps_, led by Joe Andrieu. How different people look at identity in different ways: physicality, freedom, and attributes.
   
**Use Cases**

   * _Amira: A Self-Sovereign Web of Trust Engagement Model_, led by Joe Andrieu. A use case for a programmer wanting to remain private, inspired by DIDs.
