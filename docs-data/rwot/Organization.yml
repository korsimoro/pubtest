    Civic allows people to control the use of their identity information. We use cutting

    services built on blockchain.


    We are a team spanning five countries with one common goal: to revolutionize identity.
    Keys are generated by a third-party wallet, providing a firewall between Civic
    and users'' keys. Identity data is fully encrypted in the App on the user''s device

    IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing

    trade organization of leaders from competing business sectors focused on building
    the volume and velocity of trusted transactions online. OIX enables members to
    expand existing identity services and serve adjacent markets. Members advance
    their market position through joint research and engaging in pilot projects to
    test real world use cases. The results of these efforts are published via OIX
    white papers and shared publically via OIX workshops. OIX members work together
    to jointly fund and  participate in pilot projects (sometimes referred to as alpha
    projects). These pilots test business, legal, and/or technical concepts or theory
    and their interoperability in real world use cases. OIX operates the OIXnet trust
    registry, a global, authoritative registry of business, legal and technical requirements
    needed to ensure market adoption and global interoperability.

    closely with Indigenous Nations, and is a core founder at several impactful ventures
    in blockchain, including media network CoinTelegraph.
  Description2: "![Tonilanecasserly](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloud.kumu.io/accounts/169502/111101/080ac4de-54ce-4d57-b868-00dd4fef24b7.jpg)\
    \ Toni Lane is an artrepreneur in the Digital Currency and Blockchain Industry\
    \ who has been affectionately entitled, \u201CThe Joan of Arc of Blockchain\u201D\
    \ and \u201CYoung Star of Bitcoin\u201D by her peers and various publications.\n\
    \nMiss Lane entered into the blockchain and digital currency industry in 2011\
    \ after spending three months in silent, transcendental meditation with a buddhist\
    \ monk. She came back to society curious to understand the logical structures\
    \ underpinning \"reality\", such as politics, economics and philosophy.\n\nDuring\
    \ her continued period of study, Toni Lane sensed an oncoming dissolution of many\
    \ \u201Cprincipled\u201D theories, like democracy, based on the modern day disconnect\
    \ from real world practice and founding theory of logic. Archaic human rationality\
    \ encouraged the prevalence of threats, scarcity, and violence to survive as the\
    \ myopic heartbeat of governing principles; this could not continue. Should fear\
    \ rule over self-sovereignty, self-actualization, community and deep empathy,\
    \ characteristics Miss Lane understood to be basic responsibilities of being alive,\
    \ the democracy bubble was going to pop.\n\nToni Lane came in contact with blockchain\
    \ technology in 2011, and she was hooked.\n\nNotably, Toni is working on CULTU.RE,\
    \ creating competitive marketplaces for governance and standards for self-sovereign\
    \ identity. As a humanitarian, Toni Lane used Bitcoin as a tool for direct response\
    \ to the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone.\n\nToni Lane is a co-founder of CoinTelegraph,\
    \ one of the largest media networks in the blockchain industry, and an advisor\
    \ at over 15 companies in the blockchain space. Miss Lane serves as a thought\
    \ leader for many prestigious organizations including: SingularityU, IFTF, P&G,\
    \ Cisco, HSBC and the United Nations (which she believes should not take money\
    \ from dictators, nor should they allow member states to appoint a nation as a\
    \ \"womens/human rights representative\" if it is culturally unacceptable for\
    \ a woman in that country to drive a car).  \LIn other worlds, Toni Lane lives\
    \ the life of an artist. As a vocalist, Toni Lane recently performed Chelsea Hotel\
    \ #2 at the tribute to Leonard Cohen in the Hotel Chelsea. As a poet, Miss Lane\
    \ is working on publishing her first collection entitled, \u201CEUPHORIA SPEAKING\u201D\
    .\n\nTo shift paradigms in the art world, Toni Lane has founded the \u201Cimmateralism\u201D\
    \ (post art) movement. Post Art (Immaterialism) uses consciousness as a medium.\
    \ The art pieces Miss Lane showcases are other people. Examples of her work can\
    \ be seen through readings of extreme empaths, rain dances, shared dreaming, and\
    \ tangible, evidence based works of art showcasing the conscious ability to transcend\
    \ illusions of time and space. Her work as an artist is focused on giving scientists\
    \ evidence of the unknown; unlocking forgotten knowledge in our consciousness\
    \ to guide the next generation of scientific discovery."
