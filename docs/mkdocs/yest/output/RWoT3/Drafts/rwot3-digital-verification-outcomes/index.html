    <h1 id="digital-verification-advancements-at-rwot-iii">Digital Verification Advancements at RWoT III</h1>
<p><strong><em>by Manu Sporny, Christopher Allen, Harlan Wood, Jason Law, and ...(add other participants)</em></strong></p>
<p>There were a number of enhancements made to Digital Verification at the
3rd Rebooting Web of Trust event. The following document summarises the
advancements made as a direct result of participation from the workshop
attendees.</p>
<h2 id="founding-of-the-w3c-digital-verification-community-group">Founding of the W3C Digital Verification Community Group</h2>
<p>Based on various hallway and lunch discussions, it became evident that
the community wanted a more permanent location to store artifacts and
work on them. As a result of these discussions, the W3C Digital Verification
Community Group was proposed, supported, and formed. Anyone may join the
group by going to the following URL and clicking the "Join" button:</p>
<p>https://w3.org/community/digital-verification/</p>
<p>The following specifications were migrated from the Web Payments Community
Group to the Digital Verification Community Group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linked Data Signatures</li>
<li>RSA 2016 Linked Data Signature Suite</li>
<li>Koblitz 2016 Linked Data Signature Suite</li>
<li>Pseudonymous 2016 Linked Data Signature Suite</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authoring-the-verifiable-claims-specification-privacy-and-security-section">Authoring the Verifiable Claims Specification Privacy and Security Section</h2>
<p>A group was convened to discuss the privacy and security considerations
for the Verifiable Claims Data Model and Representations specification.
The considerations were documented and integrated into the Verifiable Claims
specification, which can be found at the following link:</p>
<p>http://opencreds.org/specs/source/claims-data-model/#privacy-considerations</p>
<h2 id="creation-of-koblitz-2016-signature-suite-specification">Creation of Koblitz 2016 Signature Suite Specification</h2>
<p>The Koblitz 2016 Signature Suite was discussed, implemented, and formalized
in a Signature Suite specification designed as an extension to the
Linked Data Signatures specification:</p>
<p>http://w3c-dvcg.github.com/lds-koblitz2016/</p>
<h2 id="creation-of-pseudonymous-2016-signature-suite-specification">Creation of Pseudonymous 2016 Signature Suite Specification</h2>
<p>A pseudonymous signature suite based on the Camenish-Lysyanskaya signature
mechanism was discussed and formalized in a Signature Suite specification
designed as an extension to the Linked Data Signatures specification:</p>
<p>http://w3c-dvcg.github.com/lds-pseudonymous2016/</p>
<h2 id="addition-of-multi-signature-and-chained-signature-support">Addition of Multi Signature and Chained Signature Support</h2>
<p>A number of hallway discussions led to the general requirements and
finalization of the design for multi-signature and chained signature
support in the Linked Data Signatures specification:</p>
