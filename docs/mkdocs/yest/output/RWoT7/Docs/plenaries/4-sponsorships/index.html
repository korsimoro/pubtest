    <h1 id="sponsor-presentations">Sponsor Presentations</h1>
<p>These may give you a chance to write a better paper. They may suggest a paper, or they may suggest things you could add to a paper.</p>
<p>We <em>want</em> to write papers that connect to real needs.</p>
<h2 id="htc">HTC</h2>
<p>Taiwan, have white-labeled some phones.</p>
<p>Is part of issue where Taiwan is losing their sovereignty.</p>
<p>HTC Exodus is part of this work: a cryptocurrency and related phone. Will probably start as a standard Android phone, but there is possibility for this to expand.</p>
<p><em>They have open questions:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Social Key Recovery. Are their hardware requirements? How to do?</li>
<li>Trusted Processor. What type of APIs do you want to TrustZone?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another phone will be low-priced and may be available in Third World.</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to Moses; there may be a possibility to make a difference</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ipfs">IPFS</h2>
<p>A lot of people are using IPFS in their work, such as uPort, possibly BTRC.</p>
<p>A few requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would like to try and drive their hashes into standards project<ul>
<li>So if you're using their technology and would like to use it elsewhere, they'd like to know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe unify the way that IPFS is used in standards ways (e.g., encryption, etc)</li>
<li>A standardized cryptographic identifier format (so that we can all reuse the same building blocks)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sovrin-foundation">Sovrin Foundation</h2>
<p>Today, we have Centralized Digital Identity. Third-Party IDP (Federated) Identity has the same problems.</p>
<p>We have something better now, <em>multi-sourced identity</em>. We can each know who the other person is. We can each strongly authenticate the other person.</p>
<p>We're no longer thinking about cryptography, but about the same sort of relationship you have in the real world. Issue Credential -&gt; Verify Credential.</p>
<p><em>You're no longer an account, you're a connection.</em></p>
<p><em>Trust is built through interactions over time.</em></p>
<p>But if you don't have privacy, then multi-sourced identity falls apart, because someone can reveal everything.</p>
<h3 id="sovrins-layers">Sovrin's Layers</h3>
<p>So Sovrin works toward this with three layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sovrin Public Ledger [Cryptographic Trust]</li>
<li>Agent-to-Agent Protocols [Cryptographic Trust]</li>
<li>Credential Exchange [Human Trust]</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="trust-frameworks">Trust Frameworks</h3>
<p>A set of business, legal, and technical rules that members agree to follow in order to achieve trust.</p>
<h3 id="low-hanging-fruit-to-work-on">Low-Hanging Fruit to Work On</h3>
<ol>
<li>Trust Frameworks</li>
<li>Key Management (cross-chain, cross-compatible)</li>
</ol>
