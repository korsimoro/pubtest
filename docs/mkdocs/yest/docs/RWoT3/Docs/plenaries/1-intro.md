Welcome to Rebooting the Web of Trust (III): Fall 2016

## Origins

Where did RWoT come from?
Felt like peer-to-peer identity systems had never met promise of '90s
And worse, some systems were being REcentralized

But we were also tired of talking
Wanted to get these ideas down into paper and ship them

## Mission

The core mission is SHIP IT!
Shipping it is more important than process!

We want to make a difference in our communities & influence them.
