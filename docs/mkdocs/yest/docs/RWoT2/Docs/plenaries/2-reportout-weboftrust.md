**Rebranding the Web of Trust** (Dave, Shannon)

Mainly a semantic exercise. Might have helped some people within the workshop, but wasn't that impactful beyond that.

**Satisfying Real World Use Cases** (Drummond)

Several use cases, some of which were related to ID2020.

Has had some impact on W3C: Verify Credentials, which was looking for use cases.

**DPKI** (Greg, Markus, Jude, Christian)

Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure
Used Blockchain technology 

Impact: started looking to creating a system that's more general
With different underlying architectures

Has pioneered a few interesting ideas, especially identifiers (human-readable vs machine-readable)
Introduced a metric of decentralization

Some people are now officially working on it through a series of grants

A paper was also accepted to USENIX containing some of these core concepts

**Smart Signatures** (Chris)

Simple code that at the end verifies or doesn't verify.

Have begun to work on a language to allow for more complex options. 

Topic paper of DEX was submitted for this conference.

Impact: people are beginning to talk about it.

**What's Next** (Chris, Shannon)

We need leaders for papers to make it easy to edit them at the end.

Shannon's prefered process:

1. An editor takes control of the paper post-workshop
2. The editor queries Shannon (shannona@skotos.net) for any help needed in writing or editing of paper
3. At the end, editor hands Shannon final paper for editing
4. The editor includes rough drawings that they would like made into professional line drawings

**Feedback on Last Time**

Talk about problems, not solutions when forming groups

Don't become a standards organization: this is a knowledge hackathon

We _did_ have successes last time, including $200k in funding, a UN event, interaction with Blockstack, rolled out onto Azure.
