# Day Three Introduction

This is our last day.

We need content from everyone in the repo, preferably in markdown (MD).
   * Convert with Pandoc

Decide who the lead author is, who the co-authors are, and who the
contributors are.

We'll get all lead author emails by the end of the day, and we'll be
in contact with in the weeks ahead.

## International Women's Day

Why did we have less female attendees this time than in Boston?

Maybe timing?

Maybe some negative feedback from last time, with women feeling they
couldn't get their perspective across?

For the future, perhaps members could seek out co-authors for their
topic papers that are diverse

## IIW

A month from now in Mountain View

Discount tickets end tomorrow

## Getting People Up to Speed

Perhaps we need a half-day to get people up to speed on our tech at
our start

   * And perhaps we need someone else to do the teaching

Perhaps we need a few paragraphs on the web site to talk about our
process and _what to expect_

Perhaps we need an illustrated glossary for DID

   * Moses will take it on

## Secondary Focus

We're beginning with our secondary focus.

We have five topics, but you don't have to take on one if you prefer
what you're working on already:

   * #1. Adhaar vs Self-Sovereign ID (Joe)
   * #2. Passive Storage Network (Kulpreet)
   * #3. Key Recovery Mechanisms (Christian)
   * #4. Minimal Web of Trust Schema (Christopher)

Cut due to absence:

   * Formal Language to Model and Express Intent & Consent (Zachary)

Possible additional topics:

   * #5. Layer 2 to Support Volumes of DID (Daniel)
   * #6. Extensible APIs with Agents (Sam C.)
   * #7, DID Glossary (Moses)
   * #8. PATA Quadrilateral (Vishal)
   
## Other Logistics

We'll have surveys, which we'd like to get back before lunch.

Videos will be available by IIW.
