    <h1 id="day-one-summary">Day One Summary</h1>
<p>(unedited notes of interim report outs by #RebootingWebOfTrust teams)</p>
<h3 id="1a-a-framework-for-smart-signatures">1a. A FRAMEWORK FOR SMART SIGNATURES</h3>
<p>Bitcoin has extended idea of a signature for smart contracting and other ideas. So how can it be extended?</p>
<p>It can be used for the delegation of keys, with signature that limits their use through programmatic rules</p>
<p>Came up with specific uses
- Delegating access to server
- Delegating a limited key to certain devices
- Creating conditions on software releases
- Defining user-specific revocation</p>
<h3 id="2a-dpki-identifiers">2a. DPKI: IDENTIFIERS</h3>
<p>Identity should be an immutable key
Multiple methods of discovery
Identity stored in a registry
- Creates multiple sorts of keys</p>
<h3 id="2b-dpki-security">2b. DPKI: SECURITY</h3>
<p>Want an SIF. Security Internet, Finally.
Minimum number of techniques to create maximum amount of security</p>
<p>Two techniques
- Thin Clients
- Convergence + Block Chains</p>
<p>How many doors do you have to knock on to compromise a system? A metric for decentralization.</p>
<p>2c. DPKI: PRIVATE KEYS</p>
<p>Any system of DPKI must manage private keys for users in a way that's semi-automatic yet secure</p>
<p>Methodology:
- Break up key into shards on multiple devices</p>
<h3 id="3-what-do-we-mean-by-trust">3. WHAT DO WE MEAN BY TRUST?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The PGP term Web of Trust is overloaded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classic PGP is just Decentralized Key Validation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need a new term or to redefine Web of Trust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename or Reclaim?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-quick-spec-for-keys-misused-on-the-block-chain">4. QUICK SPEC FOR KEYS MISUSED ON THE BLOCK CHAIN</h2>
<h2 id="5-sybil-resilient-reputation-aggregation">5. SYBIL-RESILIENT REPUTATION AGGREGATION</h2>
<p>Use Case:
- Decentralized commerce platform
- Sybils can transact with each other to build up reputation
- Can't stop Sybil creation, but can it make it more costly and make users more transparent to see validity</p>
<p>Sybil-Resilient:
Consumers can detect "bad" behavior
- Best we have current is user reviews, but they're taken avantage of
- Need something better</p>
<p>System would bounce back when there's a Sybil attack</p>
<p>Reputation Aggregation:
- How we aggregate events is important to allow users to detect bad behavior</p>
<p>Result:
- Let users route themselves to actors who behave in ways that causes them to trust</p>
<h3 id="6-satisfying-the-real-world-web-of-trust-use-cases">6. SATISFYING THE REAL WORLD: WEB OF TRUST USE CASES</h3>
<p>Three themes
- Selective Disclosure
  - Ex) Proving age without showing rest of info
- People who don't have identity
  - Ex) Refugee
  - Ex) Someone with pieces of an identity (e.g., victim of domestic violence who has shed part of identity)
- Augumenting different identities
  - Ex) If don't have enough ID for a bank account, how do you get to bigger stuff?</p>
