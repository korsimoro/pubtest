This can eliminate the XDI discovery step as well the need for a-priori relationships or round trips between the XDI peers, and therefore enables immediately secure XDI connections (this is also known as a NIKE technique). The first generation of cryptographic XDI numbers is based on Ed25519 32 bit public keys and uses the cid-1 XDI scheme."

Often discussions about digital identity suffers from a lack of precise arguments where the people discussing have different internal definitions of what identity means in the context. Thus there is a lot of conflation of identity vs reputation vs biometric IDs etc. I invite everyone to critizise the terminology used here and suggest better terms where appropriate, or to point out errors or other areas that should be covered. I will try to be general and to not introduce language specific to any particular implementation or technology stack. In the examples I will cover specific implementation stacks such as PGP, Ethereum, Blockstack or a CA-based centralized approach."

However, both centralized authority-based services as well as peer-to-peer decentralized security have their own challenges. Identifying these pain points and solving them is one of the main ways that we can successfully create a new Web of Trust"

Current solutions for signing and verifying computer software — both source code and binaries — generally rely on the same flawed, hierarchical systems as our network connections do. Blockchain technology allows us to sidestep Zooko’s Triangle [zooko] and provide systems of identification that are decentralized, secure, and human-meaningful. Today’s dominant code signing and verification technologies rely on centralized certificate authorities and/or centralized hardware or operating system vendors. These solutions are typically oriented toward end-user installation of applications and do not address the needs of software developers who increasingly rely on externally developed components in both source and binary form. Open Source Software has moved us in the direction of the Bazaar [catb] and created an incredibly powerful and diverse supply chain, but has brought with it new risks. Language-specific software component repositories such as Maven, NPM, RubyGems, and CocoaPods are not as secure as they should be and yet most developers have no alternative but to assume their component downloads have not been tampered with. In the rare circumstances where developers are validating their downloaded components they’re using homegrown validation tools and often manually verifying hashes. Typically file hashes are stored on the same server as the hashed file to be validated. If the download is compromised, the hash will be too. Developers need a way of sending and receiving decentralized, secure, and human meaningful information that can be used to secure software components and applications."

Products are paid for using multi-signature escrow contracts with arbiters digitally signing transfer of funds to the seller or back to the buyer in case of disagreement over the quality or specifications of the goods delivered. The upside of bypassing centralized services such as eBay or Uber is that no third party can charge excessive fees, impose restrictive policies, prohibit Bitcoin payments or present a single point of failure in the storing of users’ personal data. However, the downside is that no organization is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the system and guard against Sybil attacks and fake ratings."

This zeitgeist can broadly be called decentralized collaboration. In the United States, organizations are atomizing into flexible services and autonomous, purpose-driven small businesses. Deloitte reports the ecosystems of value creation that are emerging create both competitive and collaborative advantage. Several forces are driving this change. Freelance work represents a significant driver. Today, freelancers and gig workers make up 34% of the US work force. In keeping with these trends, Intuit and MBO Partners optimistically predict that by 2020 freelancers will represent 43-50% of the work force. Although these numbers may be inflated, there is strong evidence that autonomous work forces are expanding. Organizational functions are unbundling to empower this atomized economy of freelancers and worker hives. Small ventures are freed to focus on core value by leveraging services like Zen Payroll, Zen99, and Zenefits for accounting; Clerky for legal support; gig work through Lyft, Uber, and Thumbtack; WeWork and Impact Hub for co-working. Crowd funding has reached mainstream participation through Kickstarter, Angel List, Mosaic Solar Financing, and Crowdfunder."

All this issues are consequences of the trustless nature of existing blockchain implementations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and (partially) Ripple that work under the assumption that there should not be a central party that controls the system. This implies the presence of a single blockchain/ledger and global consensus over it. While we fully agree on the need for decentralized financial infrastructure, we believe that techniques that are used in Bitcoin etc are not directly applicable to it. Ideas and mechanisms that are described in this paper are rather simple - 1) each entity has its own ledger(s) that contains its transactions and balances 2) there is no global shared ledger at all 3) there is no global consensus 4) there are no designated validators - financial institutions (gateways and other trusted parties) are validators. To simplify things you can imagine the existing state of the things when each business and individual has its own financial ledger and they are updated individually and then apply the blockchain data structure, cryptographic techniques and a standard set of communication protocols to it. Basically we are describing the financial internet."

This means semantics baked into the lowest levels of memory storage, self-describing protocols which let anything talk with anything else, blockchain-like abilities for decentralized data storage and computation. Our approach addresses many issues people are tackling in a variety of projects (web of trust, blockchain, semantic web, decentralized applications, federated identity, ease of interoperability, rapid code evolution with massive reuse, mesh networks, etc.) through a unified approach. We know providing such a different approach creates barriers to adoption and understanding, but we also know that applications in Ceptr will be able to be developed faster, easier and should significantly outperform projects which have been cobbled together from more traditional tools."

One of the most persistent in modern market systems is the Kenysian beauty contest. In short, when asked to pick the most beautiful person, the most profitable and efficient strategy is to predict what other people will predict, not attempt to converge on what is actually the most beautiful. Modern market systems inevitably follow this trajectory. A distributed trust ledger may follow a different logic than a market and create other tracks complementary to it. Numerous \"social web\" systems in which karma or other points are accumulated show divergent logics. Example services are Amazon reviews, Wikipedia articles, Facebook likes, Facebook friends, Twitter followers, Instagram likes, and aggregation services like Klout. In many cases, there is a very significant divergence between people who have some sort of accumulated social capital via their contributions and financial capital."

As used in PGP, in X.509 certificates used by TLS, and in other protocols, the number of private keys are few and they they do not expire for many years. Instead, to maximize privacy Bitcoin rapidly cycles through keys, discarding old keys from past transactions as soon as the public key is revealed and the coins are spent. Since each address is hashed from a public key, this means that a Bitcoin user needs to deal with a large lot of keypairs. The traditional answer for this problem has been wallets — which collect and manage keys so that users don’t have to. The earliest Bitcoin wallets still faced challenges. That’s because the Bitcoin Core and early clients generated each key randomly. Unfortunately, this methodology requires careful (and constant) backups to ensure continued access to all funds. It also opens some privacy loopholes; because new key generation wasn’t trivial, single keys were often reused when they shouldn\"t have been. Transactions could be correlated if they used the same address (and thus keypair) for change, requiring even more keys."

Additionally, individual micropayments below several cents are not worthwhile on the Bitcoin blockchain as the on-blockchain transaction fees are several cents. Lightning Network conducts net settlement of funds between two participants which allows one to conduct an unlimited amount of transactions off-blockchain, but eventually settling the transactions on-chain.  The Lightning Network does not require cooperation from the counterparty to exit the channel. Both parties have the option to unilaterally close the channel, ending their relationship. Since all parties have multiple multisignature channels with many diferent users on this network, one can send a payment to any other party across this network."

Traditionally, the answer has been to use a centralized naming system. Trusted authorities act as the root of a global name space that connects names with public keys to certify who people are. Unfortunately, this classic setup has problems. The earliest complaints focused on the 1988 x.509 standard and said that it was overly complex and overly formal. However, as the internet grew, people soon realized that there was a bigger problem: in a global name space, names quickly failed as a means of unique identity. If someone is verified by a certificate authority (CA) as Christopher Allen, who are they, really? Is it the psychic medium? The UCSF assistant professor? The security technologist? A traditional certificate can’t tell you. CA-based systems also require validation and revocation which recent SSL attacks like HeartBleed have proven have not adequately deployed or scaled to meet security requirements. Other aspects in the centrality of architecture in CA-based systems have also made them vulnerable to new forms of attacks."

At the center of this shift is how we account for trust. In order to unlock the potential of P2P and decentralized transactions taking place between entities, a relational matrix must be constructed. That is, a web of trust to empower digital entities to seamlessly and at low cost/low friction- transact with each other in a regime that can secure the interests of all parties. In other words, the next great internet revolution will take place once we can simultaneously interact with existing systems and their legally binding constructions and a new fabric for Identity and digital assets powered by algorithmic governance."

Early implementations based on the prime-number based RSA algorithm were dominant in the ‘90s. In recent years discrete logarithm and elliptic curve approaches have become more popular because they allow for improved computational efficiency and smaller key size without diminishing security. In the discrete logarithm space, ElGamal-based signature schemes have been the most deployed — thanks in large part to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) releasing their patented DSA under a royalty-free license when implementing the FIPS 186 standard in \"93. Even Bitcoin has adopted a variant of DSA: the elliptic-curve based ECDSA, which uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve."

Capability Systems are an alternative model of operating system security design. Historically, Capability Systems lost out to Access Control Lists (ACL). However, these ideas are due to be reconsidered, because Capability Systems are viable in cryptographic decentralized systems, but ACLs are not. Security systems are about granting and denying access to resources. In the physical world, we can observe a variety of approaches to security that are analogous to both ACLs and Capability Systems. For example, a your car has registration papers, which are like an access control list. These are probably administered by an organization which is administered by your government. Centralized Authority all the way up. If you cannot prove that you own or otherwise have the right to be driving a given car you may be arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle. On the other hand, the car key is analogous to a capability. If you possess the keys to the car, you can start it and drive away. If you give the keys to another driver then they have the same capability to access the car that you do."

Crypotocurrency blockchains are a potential alternative to traditional DNS and PKI systems that can provide better security and decentralization guarantees. The technology is relatively new and evolving rapidly, little production data or experience is available to guide design tradeoffs. In this paper, we summarize our experience with running a large-scale production deployment of a naming system on top of a cryptocurrency (Namecoin), and discuss how our experience informed the design of a new blockchain-based naming and PKI system called Blockstore."

However, it is not a simple role. This paper attempts to describe the role that identity plays in enabling multiple actors, each operating from their own perspective, to rely upon one another to improve their own situational awareness and take action. It then explores the expectations and pressures that identity enables actors to place upon one another, as well as the way that those expectations and pressures can change in response to shifts in the external environment. It details the relationship between privacy and transparency in the identity realm and the impact that this has on the regulation of the community as a complex adaptive system more generally. Finally, it concludes with a series of proposals for specific technical solutions to address some of the tension balancing requirements that are necessary to enable communities to self-regulate amidst changing circumstances."

A thin client (or a light client) refers to software that downloads only a portion of the blockchain [1]. This gives clients some ability to verify for themselves the authenticity of information within it. The Internet needs a blockchain agnostic and technique agnostic thin client specification. Agnosticism is essential because: Any blockchain may become abandoned by the Internet community. The “ideal blockchain” is unknown and may not exist. Non-agnostic protocols promote potentially harmful centralization."

Around the clock and around the globe, a world full of people are pumping out contributions small and large: full-length features on Vimeo; video shorts on YouTube; comments on Blogger; discussions on Yahoo!

We therefore define reputation as “information used to make a value judgment about an object or a person.” But we acknowledge the special role of the reputation(s) of a person and therefore suggest a special term for this: karma.

This implicitly forces us to only look in one particular place for one specific resource. The L at the end stands for Location, more specifically, one particular DNS name and the set of locations specified by its owner. Outside of the web, when we point to things, we use the name of the objects instead of the place where we can find it. Consider buying a book and knowing that its name is library1.com/book-12345 instead of having a name that you can try to find in several libraries - exactly like ISBN. If we can assign different names to distinct resources that everyone could agree upon (e.g. for example hash functions applied to its content) then, it doesn\"t matter where the content, since it could be on multiple locations. Having one singular location is a single point of failure, since that location could disappear, be censored and alterated."

With the ghosts of WWI still lurking, he spoke movingly about the wages of war and ongoing suffering of millions displaced by years of famine and war across Germany, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Middle East. Nansen stated that the future could not be “built on despair, distrust, hatred, and envy.” Rather, he declared, the first prerequisite for defeating the disease of conflict and war was “an understanding of the cause and nature of the disease itself.” “Such an understanding,” he cautioned, “is certainly not attainable in a day. But the first condition for its final establishment is the sincere will to understand.” 1 A polar explorer and scientist, Nansen was named the League of Nation’s first High Commissioner for Refugees in 1920. Over the next decade he helped hundreds of thousands to return home, while enabling others to become legal residents and find work in the countries where they found refuge. Nansen saw that a primary problem faced by refugees was a lack of internationally recognized identification papers. His solution was the first legal instrument for international protection of refugees, which become known as the “Nansen passport.” [2](http://stories.unhcr.org/nansen-passport- p34721.html)"

We all do it. We use the vernacular shorthand for a term because we know people will understand it.  “Identity” is one of the 3000 core words in the English language. It’s powerful and resonant.  Essentially  all English speaking persons understand it.  Yet when we speak about identity as a property of a person or thing, it is easy to gloss over the  mechanics of what’s going on and obscure the very issue we are trying to discuss. As a result, different  people use the same term to mean radically different things and smart, well‐meaning collaborators get  lost in miscommunication."

Such that the cost of implementation can be realized over a reasonable amount of time, or that the costs are irrelevant because evolving the system is an ethical necessity. In the case of the current standard of centralized identity systems both reasons for change, financial and ethical, are reasonably arguable.

Some questions/challenges around this: How should the user practically manage the keys of multiple identities (assuming for simplicity that one key controls one identity) HD wallets are a good method of managing a virtually unlimited number of keys. If HD wallets are used, should the user be responsible for storing and maintaining the seed? Is this too much of a burden for the user? If the user loses their HD wallet seed, can there be a reset feature that restores all their identities/personas? If so, how would this recovery work? A Shamir Secret Sharing scheme can be used to recover the seed from a threshold of recovery members holding pieces of the seed. This protects against loss, but not against compromise. Is there a good way that the seed can be replaced instead of reconstructed to also protect against compromise (similar to discussion about key recovery)?"

BFT protocols are hard to scale. In contrast to traditional enterprise distributed systems, adding more nodes does not improve the throughput.

The main enabler of sovereign identity is distributed ledger technology (“blockchain”). However, to implement the principles of sovereign identity, these principles must be followed right down to the most foundational architectural component: how identities are registered on a distributed ledger. This paper proposes the use of three globally unique namespaces: 1. DIDs(decentralized identifiers)—machine­generated globally unique identifiers that do not have cryptographic properties. 2. CIDs (cryptographic identifiers)—machine­generated globally unique identifiers with cryptographic properties. 3. Aliases—registered identifiers from other global namespaces that simplify discovery of DIDs and CIDs."

At all of these events I want to share a vision for how we can enhance the ability of digital identity to enable trust while preserving individual privacy. This vision is what I call “Self-Sovereign Identity”. Why do we need this vision now? Governments and companies are sharing an unprecedented amount of information, cross-correlating everything from viewing habits to purchases, to where people are located during the day, to where they sleep at night, and with whom they associate. In addition, as the Third World enters the computer age, digital citizenship is providing Third World residents with greater access to human rights and to the global economy. When properly designed and implemented, self-sovereign identity can offer these benefits while also protecting individuals from the ever-increasing control of those in power, who may not have the best interests of the individual at heart."

From the standpoint of cryptographic trust verification, each of these centralized authorities serves as its own root of trust. To make identity management work across these systems requires implementing federated identity management. The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), sometimes referred to as blockchain technology, provides the opportunity to implement fully decentralized identity management (DIDM). In DIDM, all participants with identities (called identity owners) share a common root of trust in the form of a globally distributed ledger (or a decentralized P2P network that provides similar capabilities). In a DIDM architecture, each identity owner can be identified on a ledger with a key-value pair. The index key is a decentralized identifier (DID) and the value is its associated DID description object (DDO). Together these form a DID record.

This program is currently operated mostly as a manual system with paper forms. However, this pays out many millions (USD) funding each month and the government wishes to increase funding in future years as a national priority. Large sums of money, remote communities, poor oversight, and a lack of infrastructure have inevitably created a situation where it is difficult to know how effectively the current system is performing, identify service gaps and prevent fraud, which is currently rife. There is clearly a great opportunity to leverage technology in ways that can improve the efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of social development and benefit programs such as this. Consent is implementing a Proof of Concept to create decentralized digital registries of children, their caregivers, service providers and the service centers they attend, using Decentralized Digital Identity standards. This will provide the basis for tracking the delivery of early learning services and administering the government daily attendance subsidy over future years.

This proposal provides a \"forking\" mechanism to issue attestations and spawn new identities from parent identities, in a way that attestations can be attributed to the spawned identity individually. The last section provides a federated mechanism for identities to establish their reputation data, both positive and negative, using a public blockchain.

The ideas is to have an identifier, called a DID, which maps to a descriptor object (DDO) which contains a public key. This mapping can be done in a decentralized way using a blockchain, but other ways could be used as well. The point is that if the root of trust exists in a blockchain, this forms a decentralized PKI (or DPKI). A service interacting with a user would verify a signed message by looking up the DID of the user, mapping this DID to a corresponding key and verifying that the key matches the key that signed the message. In a certificate authority based identity system the root of trust is a root key held by a certificate authority (CA). The CA signs certificates containing the keys of sub-CAs which in turn signs keys used by end-users. Thus a service interacting with an end-user can receive a signed message, check the public key that signed the message and follow the certificate chain back to the root CA."

It determines a trust value by aggregating reputations issued by other entities, where the reputations represent a subjective evaluation of the user satisfaction. This mechanism is also suitable for the identity management when using reputations to indicate (the subjective impression of) an identity’s trustworthiness.

In this network, a user’s identity profile resides in a data structure stored in a secure location under the control of the user but off the network itself. This identity profile contains attributes, each of which have been attested for by other users on the network, which uses a blockchain to verify that attestations and reputation scores are aggregated across the network correctly. An attestation from a user with a high reputation will be considered to have greater weight than an attestation from a user with a low reputation. Users are rewarded for making claims via attestations against other user’s credentials, but only if they are determined to be accurate. "

Whereas it is tempting to implement reputation on top of any identity system, a number of issues arise. The privacy problem is a major one: I may not want to disclose my recommendations in public, nor I want to show everyone who endorsed me, unless in private. In this article we explore possible ways to create and present proofs of reputation, which provide limited and owner-controlled information about reputation. We restrict to human beings only as we are primarily concerned with linkage between reputation and identity. First we identify some properties of reputation that are relevant to our study."

However, all of the transactions, licensing revenues, interests and equity generated by that intellectual property requires authentication, signatures, verification authorities and trustable timestamping. And so, self-sovereign identity and trust frameworks with algorithmic governance could be used to provide the identity infrastructure needed by the proposed system.

This method helps to ensure that no third-party can compromise the integrity and security of the system as a whole. Entities can use the system to safely authenticate each other and validate keys and certificates. Centralized key management systems (CKMS) manage key and certificate creation, signing, and validity. Specific problems arise when these authorities become unavailable, or the data they control becomes corrupted or known. Central authorities often become choice targets for attackers. This document proposes to meet these requirements with a decentralized blockchain ledger for providing an oracle of trust and leave control over all keys with end users. The use of a blockchain permits globally readable identifiers and public data to be shared in a secure manner that is not vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack or system wide compromise and permits consumers to be self-sovereign. This leaves consumers with the task of key management and protection. This document covers various ideas for how users may create, recover, backup, and revoke keys and provides recommended suggestions."

Biometric authentication is increasingly being used on mobile devices to secure private keys and other sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) in some form of trusted platform module (TPM). While on-device biometrics (NOTE: Gartner refers to on-device biometrics as \"local\" biometrics) have advantages for service providers (who want to avoid risks associated with PII loss) and users (who feel they have control of their PII if it is locked on their device), it also has important disadvantages for both users and providers, namely presentation attacks, device attacks, loss of device, and theft.

We inevitably bring our own hot buttons and agendas to any discussion of “what identity is”. Some engage from a philosophical perspective, others psychological. Some dive into political or cultural issues, while others dissect the meta-physical and spiritual. These different perspectives are valid views of identity’s impact on our lives. More than valid. Vital. They help answer the question of “Why?” Why identity matters, why we should care.

While theoretically useful, this definition unfortunately attempts to objectively assess something which is naturally subjective. Therefore, the main measure of an operational reputation system should be whether people voluntarily decide to use it. If so, it would follow that value has been added, either by lowering transaction costs or enabling trade that hadn’t been possible before. Additionally, a backwards-looking measure of success might be the predictive power of the model—did an agent defect when cooperation was predicted, and vice versa."

This paper proposes a decentralized authentication method, called the Horcrux1 protocol, in which there is no such single point of compromise. The protocol relies on decentralized identifiers (DIDs) under development by the W3C Verifiable Claims Community Group and the concept of selfsovereign identity. To accomplish this, we propose specification and implementation of a decentralized biometric credential storage option via blockchains using DIDs and DID documents within the IEEE 2410-2017 Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS)."

(All Sovrin stewards are by definition trust anchors.) However the STF V1 did not define additional roles or specific mechanisms for implementing the Sovrin Web of Trust model, leaving that to the STF V2. Based on the learnings from V1 and the progression of open standards for self-sovereign identity (SSI)— specifically DIDs and Verifiable Credentials the Sovrin Trust Framework Working Group is now developing the STF V2. This second generation will fully define the roles and implementation mechanisms for the Sovrin Web of Trust. This short paper will describe the three primary roles in the Sovrin Web of Trust model. Note that most of the terms used here are further defined in the Sovrin Glossary. A visual depiction of how these three roles intertwine to create the Sovrin Web of Trust is shown in this diagram:"

When the community is big, and it can be as big as the global community of all humanity, it is not easy to identify the real members of the community, if there is no central authority to do so. In this case I claim not only that subjective trust won\"t help much in identifying the correct community members, but rather that an objective endorsement – one that does not require the endorser even to know the endorsed person – is the best key for establishing community membership. We call a graph of such endorsements, where the claims made by the signers are objective claims, a Trustless Web-of-trust (TWOT).

Since we are living in the digital world of blockchain there is currently no definite way of representing a identity that is 100% true digitally and in the real world. However; by incorporating the concept of Web of Trust in a crypto wallet, an identity can be created to display throughout the entire web; the level of confidence there is in a specific address.

We envision such \"DID Resolver\" tools to become as central to SSI infrastructure as DNS is for the web today. Topics: There are different ways how an application or service can use a DID Resolver (e.g. as a natively linked library, or via an HTTP API). There are different ways how a DID Resolver can access a target system (e.g. direct access to a blockchain full node, access using a light client, or access via an intermediary blockchain explorer API). These different deployment scenarios have trust implications. Ideally an application or service should be as \"close\" to a DID Resolver as possible, and the DID Resolver should be as \"close\" to the target systems as possible, in order to minimize intermediaries and attack surfaces.

Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context. That’s the functional approach to identity. How we think about these processes and assets is driven by why we use identity in the first place; our primary uses of identity shape our internal mental models, which in turn shape the kinds of solutions we build. Differing priorities and perspectives also make it challenging to discuss identity with people speaking from alternate mental models. We’ve identified five distinct mental models for identity, each with its own framing, its own purpose, and its own defining question. These are five valid, independent mental models of identity. By understanding them, we can better understand how apparently disjoint ideas of identity relate to each other, enabling the discussion and engineering of better, more broadly useful identity systems."

Unfortunately, history provides many examples of first movers in a new technology not being the ones who survive in the end. The implication is that any of our current public blockchains (such as Bitcoin) might not be as popular, say, 20 years from now as they are today, resulting in a smaller participant pool and thus a greater safety risk. A way to move such assets, without requiring trust in a commercial asset pooling entity, might be beneficial."

With the advent of practical standards-based self-sovereign technology, the agents of patients and licensed clinicians can restore this direct relationship. Health data is immensely valuable to both the individual and to society. Roche recently paid about $2,000 each for a million cancer patient’s records [Roche]. Our HIE of One (for health information exchange of one) Trustee project is an implementation of current standards and standards-track technologies for human agency and decentralized information governance.

In such an environment, it’s impossible to prevent the creation of multiple accounts. Instead, it needs to be difficult to accumulate sufficient reputation across many accounts. An account’s reputation score can then act as the probability that it belongs to an individual. In order to limit actions to unique people, applications building on top would specify the score required to participate. Reputation would most likely be acquired through a Web-of-Trust model. As users trust each other (verify that they are unique), a strong network of relationships forms. The system could then use the topology the network to generate a reputation score, similar to PageRank. In order to output a global score, you would need to “anchor” to some trusted accounts, in order differentiate the real network from shadow networks of fake accounts, who all trust each other, but aren’t connected to legitimate accounts."

This enables the verification of a given data flow and the trustworthiness of output data. As the output data are used by several mobility control, risk and business systems it is important that any entity can evaluate the trustworthiness of a given output data set. The decentralized identifier (DID) is a new open standard type of globally unique identifier that offers a model for lifetime scope, portable digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and that can never be taken away by third parties. We are using DIDs as a standard identifier in our solution which is supported by the W3C community. Our approach uses cryptographic data structures to link data objects and to establish a method for data flow provenance [1]. By data flow provenance we mean a mechanism for tracing data item content and control through a processing system including any transformation to the data item. This includes flows with multiple sources, collective sensor fusion and processing by machine learning algorithms. Data flow provenance means not just tracing control but also verifying the end-to-end integrity of every data flow including any transformations (additions, deletions, modifications, combinations, and ML processing). When a DID and hence data chain of the resultant data is extended to machines, the provenance chain of the data flow can provide the basis for verifiable claims and attestations about the data flow itself as well as for reputation mechanisms. These novel verifiable data chains and reputation mechanisms allow to asses trustworthiness, reliability or risk metrics of a given output of a data chain. The applications of verifiable data chains stretch across multiple use cases including real-time vehicle value, dangerous driving, road and obstacle mapping, usage-based insurance (UBI), reliable feedback loops into driver assistance system (DAS) and autonomous driving infrastructures, V2V/V2I interactions and cooperative mobility systems. Benefits of data provenance along a digitized value chain include: reliability of data and ML labels in distributed systems increased safety maximized efficiency with less congestion, impact, costs and better services. Our verifiable data chain concept supports the overall goal to demonstrate the working BC/DLT technology components can be used and scaled today for data provenance in digital value chains."

The protocol is broadly designed to work with all aspects of trust; this includes identity, reputation, and security. The protocol is designed to be independent of specific systems and is very minimalistic. The intention is to extend the protocol with layers above rather than direct implementations. The protocol claim message data is designed to be self-provable of authenticity, by use of private/public key algorithms and the blockchain timestamping feature. This enables the protocol to be decentralized without a need for central authority, as servers can use a peer-to-peer communication system and verify all the data it receives individually, without having to rely on the sender. The Protocol allows anyone, including automated software, to issue their own cryptographic identities, for the use of trust and reputation and be able to verify those of others, without the need for a trusted third party. Users issue claims to other identities, and this way build a personal web of trust network. Users can search for claims on subjects by use of the user\"s trust network. The search only include results from trusted sources, claims from untrusted sources are not returned. The system is resistant to attacks like Sybil and bot networks as they are usually not a part of the uses networks and therefore not considered when evaluating searches. The system works on the incentive of the user’s reputation and established trust, to be a good actor within their networks, since no one will listen to them if no one trusts them. It is possible to trust anything digitally, and therefore the protocol suitable to be used for anything that requires some degree of trust shared between systems related or unrelated. The DTP protocol is ideal for identity, reputation and security management that needs to be used in a broader sense without a central authority and furthermore it can augment existing systems already in place."

Of course, this could be done with a new DID-specific protocol. However, there already exist standard protocols for proving ownership of a public/private key pair. The OpenID Connect specification defines [Self-Issued Identities(https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued) in Section 7. A self-issued identity is represented by a public/private key pair. Logging in with the self-issued identity proves control of the private key. Microsoft is experimenting with using self-issued identities to prove ownership of DIDs. This is straightforward. The DID key is used as the key for the self-issued identity. The self-issued identity is validated in the standard way. In addition, a \"did\" claim containing the DID identifier is added to the self-issued ID Token. This enables relying parties that understand that the self-issued identity is also a DID to perform DID operations after control of the key has been verified using OpenID Connect."

This is in large part due to our ability to effectively communicate by resolving these DIDs. The process of obtaining a DID Document associated with a particular DID is outlined in the DID Resolution spec. A blockchain-agnostic implementation of the spec is hosted at the Decentralized Identity Foundation and is fully open-sourced. The Universal Resolver can be found at its website and also runs locally or remotely through an API. It currently supports DIDs on Sovrin, BTCR, uPort, Jolocom, Veres One, ERC-725, Blockstack, IPFS, and DNS via a number of community-contributed drivers built on top of the Universal Resolver. Now that we can universally resolve a DID, how can we do the same with the entire DID lifecycle? All DID methods commonly share 4 operations: Create, Resolve, Update, and Revoke. We can envision a counterpart to the Resolver, called a Registrar, that contains these additional DID operations. DID Resolution is relatively straightforward because there is no authentication required and thus no keys involved. In addition, it is an atomic operation and can easily be done over the web. Creating a DID, updating its DID Document and revoking a DID\"s secret will require the same abstraction layer."

We need to configure a list of identity references such as the certificate\"s subjects or issuers. To describe the identity reference with PKI, we use X.500 Distinguished Name style strings. Suppose we want to add support for DID in a client authentication server code like the above. We need to modify the access control code of the server to add support for DID resolution. If we have a DID resolver library to implement this, it is not a difficult task. However, if we want broader deployment of DID, we need to develop a better way to add support for DID to help application developers. If we look at how to treat identity reference in an application, it is natural to develop a standard abstract data type which may store a different kind of identity references. Key Idea One of the ways to support references for multiple ID scheme everywhere is developing a general Universal ID Reference scheme, which covers not only the references to DID but also Distinguish Name-based scheme or possibly others. It is possible to develop a Universal ID framework consists of standard documents, open source libraries, and other necessary components to help using Universal ID-based system. Possible outcomes If the Universal ID based framework is ready and the traditional single-framework component is replaced with mutiple-framework capable component, it will be able to seamlessly support both DID and PKI based trust system. This change effectively enables the use of DIDs in various places."

In many aspects the SSI sector is attempting to create a ‘Blue Ocean’ strategy to shift the competitive landscape on identity in the digital realm to redefine digital identity to one of personal control. In doing so, it creates as potential competitors not only the traditional identity software providers, but also commercial enterprises that have tied control of identity into their business models (Google, Facebook). The SSI community it not some recent creation, but has evolved out of a group of individuals that have been long active in the realm of Internet identity. With the creation of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) a fundamental technology has come into the market that so far appears to enable a degree of decentralization and control that has heretofore not been achievable. As a relatively newcomer to the digital identity space, what has struck me is how passionate and tight knit this community is; over the past six months I have read, observed and spoken with many different members of different SSI projects, and the striking feature is that there exists a strong ethos of cooperation while seeking the strongest technical solutions for the sector. There are strong passions and opinions around the right and wrong way to describe or do things, but these differences are always expressed in a manner conducive to creative dissonance with the objective of creating something much better."

Protocols like OpenID Connect (OIDC) [OIDC] respectively OAuth2 and the Security Markup Language (SAML) Web Browser SSO profile is mostly used in this area. For example, behind the scenes, Google uses the OIDC protocol in their sign-in button. After user authentication and consent, and depending on the flow, clients, i.e., Relying Parties (RP), will receive up to three different tokens, i.e., id token, refresh token, access token. The RP will use these tokens with the IdP to obtain data about the user: The id token can already contain personally identifiable information, i.e., the requested data about the user. The access token (typically a bearer token) provides access to the user info endpoint, which allows the RP to request or refresh the required data. The IdP usually hosts the user info endpoint. Because access tokens are valid for a shorter period, the refresh token could be used to obtain a new access token. This approach typically has an impact on the user’s privacy by allowing the OpenID Connect Provider (OP) to track the user\"s behavior. Furthermore, relying on a bearer token has also security implications. Of course, mechanisms like token binding exist to mitigate the security issues, but they are still not common practice. While SAML loses its importance, OIDC is still there, actively maintained, and has a lot of support from the industry and many independent OIDC client implementations are available. Depending on the area, e.g., telcos or government, dedicated OIDC profiles were created that specifically address their requirements. An OIDC profile is a specific conformity configuration of pieces of the OIDC specifications, e.g., flows, parameters. While the traditional IdP approach has a lot of downsides, the underlying OIDC protocol could provide enough flexibility to support SSI."

These identities can be verifiable due to the cryptographic attestations that can be made. For example, A DID can be signed by an entity, such as a government, to improve the quality and reliability of information attached to the identity. A DID can be anchored to a public blockchain which acts as a registry. Interrogating a public blockchain allows a user to find, reference, revoke or update a DID. Only the user possessing cryptographic evidence to a DID can make state changes and prove ownership. Services that implement DID infrastructure allow users to be the source of truth for their online identity, removing ownership from third parties or other central authorities."

While still making it simple enough for all the users and keeping the needed level of trustworthiness. Sharing is what provides the end value for both the verifying and the sharing party. If there is no sharing, the issuance of the VC has gone to waste. Hence if we are to provide value for the sharing party today, we have to ask the questions of where is this adopted, how can we make this adoption effortless? Can we put most of the work on the service providers? Is the user or another service expected to install software? If so, install software where?
