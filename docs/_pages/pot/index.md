# People

Who are the people involved in identity-tech?  Who are the primary influencers
and how are they connected to organizations.

# Organizations

Organizations are groups of people that have a name and some sort of presence.
This includes
  - Open Source Projects
  - Companies and Businesses
  - Governments and NGOs
  - Schools, Universities, and other Educational bodies
  - Trade Unions
  - Working groups, Motorcycle clubs, of anything with a charter
  - Sub-parts of any of the above


# Things

Things are all the bits of nameable stuff that are not people or organizations.
For example, a ```technology``` or a ```concept``` count as things in this
context.
