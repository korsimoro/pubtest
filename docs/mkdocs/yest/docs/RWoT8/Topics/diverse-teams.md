# Assist underrepresented groups when entering the labour market through self sovereign identity

### Authors

## Abstract

One issue within various branches is a lack of diversity, diversity meaning: seeing people irrespective of gender, race, religion, culture or sexual orientation. How can digital decentralised identities help?

Some points that will be covered:

-   allowing job applicants to approach new positions by incorporating digital identities in the application and hiring process

-   giving applicants control over the components of their identity that they wanna provide

## Background

Barcelona, Spain, Diversity in Tech

### Problem Statement

As a consequence of increasing migration we have workers educated by a wild mix of educational systems, this should not be limiting them from approaching and receiving positions that they actually would like to work in and would be suitable for. Official diplomas and certificates, proving previous studies and work experience, are not necessarily recognised, available in physical form or easily translatable in a certified manner. In addition to that and estimate of the World Bank states that 1 Billion of people are without a formal identity. Being assigned one would give them better access to the work market since just their physical presence and knowledge is not enough in many cases, but rather we require proof for education and experience.

### Why Decentralise or Web of Trust?

By having more control over their identities underrepresented groups could be perceived more independently of what really matters to work, which is the quality of your work and your experience and education.

Using verifiable claims references to degrees completed in universities and institutions all over the world can be presented and are directly verified. Own digitally verified documents also protects against loss of academic records.

### What existing solutions do we have?

SelfKey allows to store documents in a digital wallet which are also certified by and identity owner, ( i.e. a notary ) this also reduces the bureaucratic workload and removes the need to make long trips around the globe to figure out paperwork, once a document is certified digitally it is always available. Having references to certified documents easily available protects against loss of academic records.

### What can be improved?

Make SSIDs available and accepted in the context of the work market and further develop it to make it a valid part of a job application and hiring process. Follow through to find a concept using APIs specifically designed to give access to employers to educational data that has been shared by an applicant, because it is conducive to make a decision about the candidate qualification only based on meaningful information.

### Final Point

 A point to be discussed could be that to create more diverse teams we need to change our mindset  rather than adjusting information we share, the author of the document indicates that our technologies need to represent the notion of our mindsets to put our beliefs into practise.
