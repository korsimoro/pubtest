<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Reputation systems provide an effective way to build a web of trust on
the Internet. They consider the history of interactions between peers to
establish a measure for a reputation that can itself be used to support
a trust decision. Decentralised reputations systems (DRS) rely on a
decentralised computer architecture and a distributed ledger to store
and maintain reputation information, so that no single entity has
control over that information.</p>
<p>While there have been numerous analyses of how reputation may be used,
there has to date been no systematic definition of the various aspects
that should be considered when a reputation system is being designed. By
defining these design considerations, we can come to a consensus about
what is and is not important in a system. We can discuss the different
ways in which they can be built and we can conduct further research and
analysis into specific factors in a structured way.</p>
<p>We identified ten design considerations for all decentralized
reputations should address. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: What is the reputation value applicable to? What can be
    understood about an entity by seeing their reputation value(s)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participation</strong>: How is participation defined? Who can and can’t
    participate? Who can and can’t have a reputation value assigned?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User consent</strong>: Is consent required by a user to issue claims or a
    reputation value against the user? Is consent required to reveal
    claims or a reputation value of a user?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: To meet consent requirements, how is data that
    calculates a reputation value kept private? Can it be derived?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Value generation</strong>: How is the reputation value calculated or
    generated? How are claims contributing to the reputation value
    normalized?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: How does the system manage the performance and
    behavior of the users? How does it manage the performance of the
    network for speed, reliability, and data integrity? How do users
    have confidence in this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong>: How does the system stay relevant over time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Claim lifecycle</strong>: How are claims valued over time? Can they be
    revoked and under what conditions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>: How does the system protect against attacks that
    reduce the integrity of the reputation value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal</strong>: What is the legal environment in which the system sits?
    Are there potential violations of ‘natural’ law?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of this paper will further define these considerations and
populate each with examples and considerations for their design. We will
continue to develop and refine to establish language standards for
discussing reputation systems.</p>
<p>We have not defined what is and isn’t required for each consideration,
as particular implementations may have differing reasons for each.
However, we anticipate that best practices for these considerations will
be topics for future analysis.</p>
<h2 id="previous-work">Previous Work</h2>
<p>Resnick et al.[^1] detail three high-level properties that reputations
systems require and highlight challenges related to the capture
(difficulty of enticing users to provide feedback; eliciting negative
feedback; and ensuring honest reports), distribution (problems with name
changes of users; and the lack of portability between different systems)
and aggregation of feedback.</p>
<p>Kumar et al.[^2] look at design considerations that are specific to
establishing the reputation of computer nodes in a peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p>Koutrouli et al.[^3] look at the basic element and design issues of
reputation-based trust models in peer-to-peer systems, so that each peer
can make autonomous trust decisions based on other peers’ reputations.</p>
<h2 id="1-context-dependence">1. Context Dependence</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> The formal set of hypotheses used to define the value
scale of reputation statements in the system and the scope to which the
reputation value applies.</em></p>
<p>Every reputation system should clearly define the context to which a
reputation applies. For example, a high reputation on StackOverflow may
correlate with someone being a strong developer, but the reputation
context in fact is more aligned with quickly providing useful
information; a person’s ability to architect a project or to make design
trade-offs in time-limited projects, which may be considered valuable
traits for a developer, may not align with this.</p>
<p>In a decentralized reputation system, care should be taken when defining
rules that determine the context of use for reputation claims. Designers
should pay attention to implicit rules that could be unclear to users.
For example, a 4-out-of-5-star rating is considered excellent on some
platforms but poor on others.</p>
<p>To improve on the precision of the specific value to be measured,
granularity may be increased, but traded off for usability. When you
want a user to be more precise in the reputation value he gives to
others, you can as a designer make him be more precise by increasing the
granularity of the fields he fills. You don’t ask for a single five-star
rating anymore, but instead split the response into different categories
for which the user can give a rating independently. Systems with more
granularity will be less usable by users, but may be able to provide
more information with a proper analysis.</p>
<p>Different contexts can exist in the same reputation system or in
different ones. Reputation system operators could be tempted to merge
numerical values from different contexts, either in the same system or
in different systems, but matching between contexts should be made with
explicit rules that are carefully targeted at this precise matching.
This creates a new context, with its own rules and guides of conduct.</p>
<h2 id="2-participation">2. Participation</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> The rules by which entities can determine whether or
not they will partake or be considered by the network or by which the
network determines the participation of entities.</em></p>
<p>The network should clearly lay out the rationale and implementation of
two aspects of participation:</p>
<p><em>1. Who is allowed to join the network?</em></p>
<p>Membership in the network may bring with it different capabilities, so
this may not be a binary decision. One member may be a passive member
with little rights beyond viewing traffic on the system, while another
may be able to submit claims as they reach a higher level of membership.
The rules for each role, the purposes of each role, and how they will be
enforced should be clearly defined.</p>
<p><em>2. Who is allowed to have a reputation assigned to them by the
network?</em></p>
<p>This question is closely related to context: who is eligible to have a
reputation in this system? Clear rules need to define who can receive a
reputation and to balance such requirements against entities’ rights to
privacy. Note that this only defines which entities can have a
reputation linked to them: it is separate from whether or not that
entity chooses to reveal that reputation.</p>
<h2 id="3-consent">3. Consent</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> the rules by which entities accept claims against them
or allow the viewing of claims or reputation values.</em></p>
<p>Once an entity is participating in a network, a system design needs to
consider to what extent the entity has control over the claims made
against them and the reputation information that is associated with
them. Consent considerations fall into a few categories. Not all of
these requirements will be necessarily be present in any system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consent to reveal</strong>: to what extent can an entity who has received
    a reputation value reveal in whole, reveal in part, or decline to
    reveal their reputation value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consent to inbound claims</strong>: does an entity have the right to
    accept in whole, accept in part, or reject in whole a claim made
    against them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consent to outbound claims</strong>: can an entity define who can see a
    claim that they have submitted against another entity or any
    information related to that claim?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Right to be forgotten</strong>: can the recipient of a reputation value
    delete or hide that reputation? A legal base for the right to be
    forgotten is given by Article 12 of the Directive 95/46/EC of the
    European Union<a href="[*http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046*](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046)">^4</a>. It provides for the “erasure or blocking of
    data processing”. In the context of DRS, the right to be forgotten
    may involve the full deletion of all data used for computing the
    reputation value, or a restriction to aggregate such data, or a
    restriction to associate such data with the related emitting or
    receiving individual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-confidentiality">4. Confidentiality</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> How to ensure that no data is leaked and that other
considerations are not violated by derivation of metadata or analysis.</em></p>
<p>While an entity may choose their level of participation, choose what
claims are made against them, and choose to whom their reputation is
revealed through considerations of “Participation” and “Consent”, the
system needs to be designed so that the method of achieving each of
these attributes is secure and does not leak information nor even data
that enables information to be derived.</p>
<p>This information falls into a number of categories, for a case where
Alice is sending a claim against Bob.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-of-sender-alice">Privacy of Sender (“Alice”)</h3>
<p>This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sender Unlinkability.</strong> Alice limits the set who knows she vouched
    for Bob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connections Unlinkability.</strong> Alice prohibits exposure of the fact
    that her two connections were endorsed by the same person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uncountability.</strong> Alice limits knowledge of how many claims she
    issued over any period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grade Privacy.</strong> Alice prohibits exposure of her submitted claim
    not only by itself (through Consent) but as a whole through which it
    could be derived, for example the most popular, average, or
    empty values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Context Privacy.</strong> Alice prohibits exposure of the context she
    endorses not only individually (through Consent) but as a whole, for
    example the most popular context or unused contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Privacy.</strong> Alice prohibits exposure of the time when she
    sends claims not only individually (through Consent) but as a whole,
    for example the most active time, passive time, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revocation Privacy.</strong> Alice prohibits exposure of
    revocation-specific data: connections with revoked endorsements,
    without revoked endorsements, validity time, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="privacy-of-recipient-bob">Privacy of Recipient (Bob)</h3>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sender Unlinkability.</strong> Bob limits the set who knows Alice sent a
    claim against him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connections Unlinkability.</strong> Bob prohibits exposure of the fact
    that his two connections endorsed the same person (Bob).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uncountability.</strong> Bob limits knowledge of how many endorsements he
    received over any period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grade Privacy.</strong> Bob prohibits learning of his claim values not
    only individually (through Consent) but as a whole, for example the
    most popular claim, average claim, empty claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Context Privacy.</strong> Bob prohibits learning of the context in which
    a claim was submitted, not only individually (through Consent) but
    as a whole, for example the most popular context, unused context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Privacy.</strong> Bob prohibits exposure of the time when he
    received claims, not only individually (through Consent) but as a
    whole, for example the most active years and months or inactive
    years and months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-privacy">Group Privacy</h3>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group Unlinkability.</strong> Groups whose members endorse each other
    much more often than others (classmates, colleagues) may not be
    detected by design.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above definitions are examples. However, each design should balance
the need for metadata that may assist in analysis and identification of
bad actors against the potential for network attack.</p>
<h2 id="5-value-generation">5. Value Generation</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> the process to establish the reputation value of an
entity on the reputation network based on the required inputs.</em></p>
<p>The value-generation process is the ultimate utility of a DRS, and
consequently requires significant design and protections to ensure it
accurately represents the context it has been defined to evaluate. The
value may not necessarily be numeric.</p>
<p>Various factors that may need to be defined in the generation of such a
value include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Value factors – What are the factors that contribute to the overall
    value?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initialization of information – Do the factors need initialization?
    Are there default values? Do all need to be included?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregation and transformation – What process brings these factors
    to the ultimate value? This may include sums, convolutions, or more
    complex transformations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claim threshold – Are there a minimum number of claims that need to
    be submitted against an entity before a value can be generated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context – What assumptions are being made about the factors? Do they
    align with the context?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ranking/normalization – Are some factors or claims worth more than
    others?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timeliness – Do some factors carry less weight due to time elapsed
    since they were set or defined?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavioral – Does a reputation value change depending on how it has
    been used or an entity’s behavior?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="6-performance">6. Performance</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> how to ensure the network and its participants perform
as expected.</em></p>
<p>System performance is a key aspect to consider, as perceived reputation
as conveyed by any reputation score is intimately linked to the
legitimacy of the system producing reputation artefacts (scores,
ranking, color, category, etc.). While legitimacy is a function of much
more than pure performance, we focus here strictly on performance.</p>
<p>Performance of decentralized reputation networks can be considered to
fall into two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>System performance as an aggregation of individual
    node performances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System performance as a function of architectural design choices, or
    at the network level.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="node-performance">Node Performance</h3>
<p>The requirements for nodes on a DRS should be clearly defined to ensure
that they can contribute effectively to the network, in addition to
enabling the rapid identification of errors or bad actors the and
mitigation of flow on effects.</p>
<p>Some <strong>key factors of performance</strong> of connected nodes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Availability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External and internal consistency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of bad actors, who through corruption, collusion,
    gaming, or otherwise are maliciously altering the intended utility
    of the network</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Node performance can be <strong>measured by</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Liveliness (availability)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error rates (reliability)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribution functions (consistency)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corrections (capabilities)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Measurable node performance can in turn be leveraged in order to improve
the performance of the whole system, through incentivizing good
performance via monetary and non-monetary means, and/or punishment of
bad performance via monetary and non-monetary means, up to exclusion
from the network.</p>
<h3 id="network-performance">Network performance</h3>
<p>An effective distributed network is scalable, with maximum uptime, and
coordinates communication between nodes in a rapid, efficient manner.
Network performance can be <strong>monitored using different indicators</strong>,
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number of active nodes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node failure rate</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network power and topology</strong> may also need to be defined in advance,
depending on the needs of the network.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is there a minimum number of nodes needed to effectively function?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the consensus mechanism? Are its speed and mechanics
    suitable for the context of the system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the degree of decentralization inherent in the system? How
    might clusters of nodes impact the performance of the reputation
    network?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Built-in rules regarding <strong>responsiveness of the network</strong> will likely
be required, and these should be defined in correlation with the defined
performance considerations.</p>
<h2 id="7-sustainability">7. Sustainability</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> The system’s ability to evolve and remain accurate over
time.</em></p>
<p>Being distributed and self-governing, a DRS will consequently be
difficult to modify on a regular basis. As a result, designing the
system to be consistent and valuable over time will likely require
considerable design.</p>
<p>It is likely that peers of the network themselves, rather than a central
authority, will define and enforce the shared ethics and desires of the
user population, however the ethics and desires to be enforced would
need to be incorporated into the system’s design from the start. Such a
design may allow for nodes or entities on the network to signal for such
changes when required, or may construct incentives in such a way that
the market naturally corrects any diversions with time.</p>
<p>These desires and ethics may include any aspect of any one of the design
considerations.</p>
<h2 id="8-claim-life-cycle">8. Claim Life-cycle</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> how to manage claims made on the network and the
impacts they may have over time.</em></p>
<p>The network should define the conditions whereby claims that contribute
to a reputation score are considered applicable or not applicable to the
score over time.</p>
<p>These conditions may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Time to live – Alice may submit a claim that Bob is up to date with
    his rent payments, with a time to live of one month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decay – Alice may submit a claim that Bob is untrustworthy. Over
    time Bob may change his behavior, so the claim loses its value
    gradually over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dispute resolution/adjudication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-resilience">9. Resilience</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of the system to tolerate malicious
behaviour.</em></p>
<p>Reputation systems need to be resilient to attacks to be of any use in
the real world. Attacks against reputation systems in general aim at
distorting the utility of the network — that is, the reputation of a set
of participants. Some attacks are well studied in literature and we
refer to them as “traditional” attacks on reputation systems.
Decentralization, while alleviating the need for a single point of
failure (SPOF) raises additional concerns, documented below:</p>
<p><strong>Traditional attacks on reputation systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Self-Promoting – Raise reputation of one’s self through false
    feedback, which can be facilitated via a Sybil attack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whitewashing – Leave the system and re-enter with a new “name” if
    reputation is low</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slandering (Bad-mouthing) – Lower the reputation of a competitor via
    false feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ballot stuffing[^5] – Collusion between the recipient and sender of
    the reputation claim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixed (orchestrated, byzantine) – combination of the above</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Denial of Service (DoS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Censorship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single Point of Failure (SPoF)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These attacks have been documented and analyzed in several academic
papers[^6]^,^[^7]^,^[^8].</p>
<p><strong>Special concerns for decentralized systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Codebase development and maintenance – Code on the nodes does not
    need to be uniform but the interfaces must match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information withholding – A recipient of reputation only discloses
    partial information about himself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stale information – A recipient of information discloses outdated
    information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of defenses is interdependent with design decisions of other
sections. For example, the participation mechanism is very important to
the mitigation of Sybil attacks that in turn facilitate many of the
traditional attacks mentioned above.</p>
<p>Blockchain constructs can mitigate some of the attacks outlined above.
For some other attacks, additional measures are necessary. For example,
many designs do not implement negative reputation, as this is
notoriously difficult to secure. Others rely on a limited endorsement
budget or tie an endorsement to a financial transaction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there may be an inherent Security and Privacy trade-off. For
example, when Alice assesses the reputation of Bob, she may wish to
learn as much information as possible in order to avoid attacks.</p>
<h2 id="10-legal">10. Legal</h2>
<p><em><strong>Definition:</strong> the legal environment in which the network may
operate.</em></p>
<p>All technology fits within some form of society, and society has a
strong interest in preventing attacks upon a person’s identity and
reputation. It also seeks to redress them while maintaining the ability
for people to express their opinion. Consequently, it is wise to
consider any state-bound or natural law when implementing a DRS to
ensure there is limited exposure for the participants and the creators
in such a network.</p>
<p>For example, reputation is the respect or esteem which a person (the
trustee) enjoys in Society or what people (the trustors) think of
him/her. An important element in the protection of reputation is the
wrong of defamation. Designers of DRS should therefore bear in mind some
of the remedies that law generally provides for defamation. Aside from
compensatory damages there are also motions to identify the defamatory
party. injunctions to prevent further publication of defamatory
information.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The authors believe that the above ten design considerations can be used
as a framework to design and implement effective decentralized
reputation systems. While the decisions for each consideration have been
left open in this paper, each can be analyzed further to establish
industry best practices to set a benchmark for a human-driven future web
of trust.</p>
