Kaliya Young and Ben Werdmuller are working on a paper to outline all of the various protocols innovated in the past 15 years to support the idea of a distributed social web. We have had one brainstroming session so far and plan to meet at least twice more before RWT in October. The paper should serve as a resource to consdier how we actually build socail and interative tools with this new infrastructure. As we all know names to nowhere are not useful. I think it is important to start.
