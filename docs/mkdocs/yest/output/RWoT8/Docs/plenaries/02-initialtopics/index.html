    <h1 id="initial-topics">Initial Topics</h1>
<p>These are the topic papers that bubbled up from our initial discussion
sections.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping-use-by-real-people-without-single-entity-dominance">Bootstrapping Use by Real People without Single Entity Dominance</h2>
<p>How do you get real people to trust and use this technology that
doesn't lead again to single entities dominating? Because that's what
we're trying to get away from.</p>
<h2 id="openconnect-ss-i">OpenConnect + SS-I</h2>
<p>How do we combine the two? </p>
<p>How to connect with the existing infrastructure of legacy systems?</p>
<h2 id="social-key-recovery-using-trust-circles">Social-Key Recovery Using Trust Circles</h2>
<p>How do we recover a secret used in a identity wallet using a circle of
friends, next-of-kin, etc.</p>
<p>There are existing schemes, like Shamir. But, this doesn't map well
into actual social networks. Might need to create new requirements.</p>
<h2 id="did-authentication-with-libp2p">DID Authentication with Libp2p</h2>
<p>How to authenticate in a bidirectional way between different
methodologies? </p>
<h2 id="eidas-ss-i-profile">EIDAS SS-I Profile</h2>
<p>Legal recognition with EIDAS system. Can later be extended to other
legal frameworks. </p>
<p>Merge benefits of SS-I with legal system of EIDAS.</p>
<h2 id="verifiable-credentials-interoperability">Verifiable Credentials Interoperability</h2>
<p>How we can move through a use case like Amira or Joram where different
actors are all using slightly differrent systems. </p>
<p>Want to explore UX and VC dance.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>There's a lot of different ideas for what terms mean, starting with
identity and moving to many others. </p>
<p>There is a process that can be used to allow people to provably agree
on terminology. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-boostrap-the-web-of-trust-or-verifiable-credentials">How Do We Boostrap the Web of Trust (or Verifiable Credentials)?</h2>
<p>In current situation, a verifier has to trust an issuer. This requires
a mapping of real-world and digital identities of issuer. </p>
<p>So, we need to get word out to verifiers that there's a demand for
verifiable credentials, and this gap needs to be closed.</p>
<h2 id="dids-for-everything">DIDs for Everything</h2>
<p>All machines and objects and digital agents (and people) all need DIDs
as identity foundation.</p>
<p>We can create machine data-chains and then can assess whether we can
trust everything in chain.</p>
<h2 id="legal-frameworks-for-humanity-in-the-digital-age">Legal Frameworks for Humanity in the Digital Age</h2>
<p>What is correct legal framework for data and how do we implement them
technically.</p>
<p>And how does that influence business model, UX, and others?</p>
<h2 id="legal-rights-to-commercialize-protect-and-defend-emerging-tech">Legal Rights to Commercialize, Protect, and Defend Emerging Tech</h2>
<h2 id="how-can-we-use-dids-and-vcs-in-humanitarian-sector">How Can We Use DIDs and VCs in Humanitarian Sector?</h2>
<h2 id="universal-did-operations">Universal DID Operations</h2>
<h2 id="safety-credentials-and-ss-i-trojan-horse">Safety Credentials and SS-I Trojan Horse</h2>
<h2 id="staying-anonymous-with-dids">Staying Anonymous with DIDs</h2>
<h2 id="illustrating-user-stories-such-as-joram">Illustrating User Stories, such as Joram</h2>
<h2 id="did-key-management-on-the-web">DID Key Management on the Web</h2>
<p>The Web has a different security model than native platforms (e.g. mobile apps) and even, limited access to native device capabilities (e.g secure cryptoprocessor chips). We explore these limitations and how they apply to DID key management.</p>
<h2 id="universal-postal-unions-and-dids">Universal Postal Unions and DIDs</h2>
