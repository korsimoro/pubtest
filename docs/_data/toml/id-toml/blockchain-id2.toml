An identity application is a software product that allows users to establish (verify), store, and manage identities. The identities that an identity application platform can store include those of people, things, and of other objects. The current, initial, release of the Blockpass app provides an identity solution for humans. Future releases will include solutions for devices and objects. \n\nA self-sovereign identity application is a platform where users can establish, store, and manage identities whilst maintaining full control over all data involved. Data collected to establish a self-sovereign identity is not stored on any central server. Instead, the data is passed to the verifier (be it a machine or a human) to view only for so long as is required to create the identity. When the verification is completed, the data is sent back to the user’s own personal device. "
