<p>Notes by Andrew Hughes (AndrewHughes3000@gmail.com)
March 8, 2018
RWOT #6 Santa Barbara</p>
<p>The topic of the discussion was:
* What is the Minimum Viable schema to serve the needs of a cryptographic web of trust?
    * For example, an Entity asserts that ‘Kate’ is in possession of ‘her’ private key
    * or, Entity calls other DID using an Edge Name
    * or, X is able to get an introduction to Me so that I can start to assemble a view of trust (bootstrapping the relationship graph)</p>
<p>The participants did not discuss schemas directly. The conversation turned to the kinds of assertions that such a cryptographic web of trust might want to assert.</p>
<p>What are the assertion primitives?
Notes:
* These assertions are all from the perspective of one Entity (known as 'The Entity' towards another Entity.
* Entities are expected to possess many DIDs, therefore the perspective is that the Entity will only know a subset of DIDs for another Entity
* The Entity can be a person, group, software agent or thing.</p>
<ol>
<li>An assertion that The Entity has performed DID Auth on another DID<ul>
<li>DID Auth is cryptographic proof that a DID claimed by an Entity pertains to that Entity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An assertion that The Entity has done some verification of another Entity’s existence or that Entity’s verifiable credentials<ul>
<li>The assertion might be ‘IS_A_PERSON’ or ’Presented a driving license’ or ‘Biometric witness’ (supervision of the biometric capture event), or other Identity Proofing &amp; Verification actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An assertion of The Entity’s ‘Introduction Name' for itself<ul>
<li>Introduction Name: what one Entity uses as an Edge name for another DID</li>
<li>‘Intro Name’ is a new suggestion for ‘Anchor name'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assertion of The Entity's Edge Name for another DID</p>
<ul>
<li>“That DID is known as <blah>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(maybe) Permission for an entity to share the assertions with other DIDs</p>
<ul>
<li>Warning that this goes beyond ‘pairwise’ and so is beyond Minimum Viable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note: Christopher would like the ability for a collection of people to assert that they are a member of the collection of people - this might be a variant on #3 where Entity is a collective or group of entities</p>
</li>
<li>Manu: why not solve for messaging systems that use DIDs - ‘Signal with DIDs instead of phone numbers’. This might be a high value solution that would be supported by the assertion primitives.<ul>
<li>Christopher: note that the introduction problem still exists</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dave: Maybe the ‘vouching for’ activity is the highest value activity<ul>
<li>The Journalist scenario might be a good story to tell - e.g. for whistleblowers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‘Intro name” is our name for the ‘Anchor name’ from the 'petnames' group</li>
<li>Manu: the primitives are fine, but there’s no money in it :-)</li>
<li>Kate: talked about the spectrum of control of namespaces</li>
<li>Chris: if this could be implemented for ToR browsers then there’s a ready-made audience that would value the solution</li>
<li>Andrew: What are the Functional Identity nouns and verbs for the primitives?
*</li>
</ol>
