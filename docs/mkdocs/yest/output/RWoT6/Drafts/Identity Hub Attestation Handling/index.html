<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this document, we define a set of user flows and describe the associated Action Objects that support a Hub-centric approach to the request, issuance, presentation, verification, and revocation of interoperable attestations. This document extends the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/hubs/blob/master/explainer.md">Identity Hub Explainer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>In the digital identity space, Hubs let you securely store and share data. A Hub is a datastore containing semantic data objects at well-known locations. An identity needs to be able to prove that some data is true to another entity that requests it. These attestations are that method of proof. In the digital world, the requester may be software, and the response may or may not require involvement of the individual/identity who the proof is being made against. These examples and flows depict how attestations are requested and resolved.</p>
<h2 id="2-example-use-cases">2 Example Use Cases</h2>
<p>We use examples here to give guidance/suggestions for how attestations can be used with real-world examples. The overall use case is a person, Alice, who registers for College using a process that includes using an attestation she possesses to prove she has received some required immunizations. After graduation, Alice requests an attestation from the College that she has graduated, and presents that attestation to her professional profile on a professional network.</p>
<h4 id="agents">Agents</h4>
<p>We use the term “User Agent” (UA) to refer to an app on a smartphone or other device that has access to DID-linked keys and the power to do things on behalf of a DID owner (Alice). This could also be referred to as a digital wallet. Similarly, we use the term “Enterprise Agent” (EA) to refer to the comparable component representing an Organization – e.g. a College or professional network. A UA and EA are conceptually the same, but while the UA is likely a personal device (laptop, tablet, phone), an EA is likely a service that processes requests based on business rules and data held in back-end systems. Note that an EA might need input from a specific member of the organization to complete the processing of a request. In that case, the EA might contact that user through that person’s User Agent (although there are many other possibilities).</p>
<h4 id="sites">Sites</h4>
<p>In the examples below, “Sites” are assumed to be Web or Mobile Site – user interfaces that allow a user (in our case, Alice) to trigger the start of a process. There are many other ways to trigger the start of such a process.</p>
<h4 id="decentralized-ids-dids-documents-and-attestations">Decentralized IDs (DIDs), Documents and Attestations</h4>
<p>Each of Alice's Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) referenced in the scenarios is generated and held by her user agent (UA) and used for a specific purpose - for example her relationship with the College. Her DIDs are not necessarily correlated to any other identifiers that make up her identity. Per the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">W3C DID Specification</a>, a DID Document is associated with a DID  that contains information about the public keys and service endpoints for that DID. Thus, given a DID and DID Document for another Identity, an entity has a mechanism to resolve and communicate with the Identity Owner of the DID. DIDs may be public and stored on a publicly available Distributed Ledger, with their associated DID Document found via the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">DIF Universal Resolver</a>, or may be pairwise private DIDs, where two Identities directly exchange DIDs/DID Documents.</p>
<p>An attestation is something (such as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a>) issued by an entity to a holder (often the subject of the attestation) so that the holder can prove  to others that they hold the attestation. In one of the examples below, for instance, Alice wants to receive a graduation attestation from the College so that she can present (prove) that attestation to a professional network.</p>
<h4 id="interface-guidelines-hubs-agents-and-identity-owners">Interface Guidelines: Hubs, Agents and Identity Owners</h4>
<p>Some basic guidelines are defined about Hubs, Agents, and their Identity Owners:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Private keys are accessible only to Agents (User and Enterprise), thus any encrypting/signing of information must be done by an Agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, Hubs are addressable using the service pointers located in a DID Document, and Agents are addressed via a user's Hub. The only exception is invocation of a User Agent through direct mechanisms, like a deep link on a mobile site, a QR code on a Web site scanned by a User Agent, or a Bluetooth/NFC data exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hubs generally have limited, generic functionality, and any decision making must be made at the Agent level via a user app/device (User Agents) or more automated business services (Enterprise Agents).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For simplicity, we show the Hub and Enterprise Agent as a single entity in the following scenarios. In typical implementations, they will be separate entities that communicate to accomplish their respective activities.</p>
<h3 id="21-alice-links-to-an-entity">2.1 Alice Links to an Entity</h3>
<p>In order to communicate a request for attestation to an entity (in our examples, Alice), a user will first need to establish a connection between her user agent and the entity she will interact with. This is necessary for all follow-on scenarios.</p>
<p>Alice wants to transact with the entities described in the scenarios with the intent to receive or exchange attestations. First and foremost, the entity must verify that Alice is the owner of the decentralized identifier she claims. In order to find Alice’s user agent, we leverage the Universal Resolver (UR) to lookup Alice’s Decentralized Identifier (DID) to find her DID Document (DDO). The keys located in Alice's DDO are used to authenticate Alice’s ownership of the DID and to determine access to Alice’s hub and user agent.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Alice navigates to an entity’s website and clicks a link to initiate a DID linkage with the entity. The content received from clicking the link includes DID information about the Enitity that Alice should use for the relationship.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice may have to use the Universal Resolver to access the DID Document associated with the DID.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entity prompts for Alice to disclose a DID that represents her digital identity.</p>
<ol>
<li>If  the website was accessed via a laptop/desktop, the website typically displays a QR Code, and Alice uses her mobile wallet app to scan the QR. If the website was accessed via her mobile device, a protocol handler raises Alice's AU app.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice selects an existing DID or creates a new DID for this relationship and sends the DID to the Entity Site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Entity Site passes the DID to the Entity’s Enterprise Agent to initiate the DID Auth response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EA uses the Universal Resolver (UR) to request retrieval of the DID Document that matches the provided DID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DID Document is returned to the EA.</p>

<li>
<p>The EA initiates the DID Auth process by issuing a challenge to Alice’s Hub.</p>

<h4 id="211-dif-identity-hub-2fa">2.1.1 DIF Identity Hub 2FA</h4>
<p>A second identity linking scenario to consider is when Alice is registering with the site using a device that is not a UA,  yet she still wants to use her UA to establish the connection. In this case, Alice discloses a DID connected to her UA to the site, the site contacts the UA and the mobile device containing the UA displays a code for Alice to use. Alice enters the code into a form on the site, proving that she controls the DID.</p>

<h2 id="3-action-objects">3 Action Objects</h2>
<p>Identity Hub attestation handling relies on the passage and recognition of common Action types that Hubs, User Agents, and consuming apps/services understand. In order to ensure that the flows related to attestations are precise and maximally descriptive of their intent, the Identity Hub spec will define its own Action objects for each of the relevant attestation actions. These objects are extensions of the Schema.org Action object, the schema origin of which shall be schema.identity.foundation. These objects are strictly a shared means of communicating and facilitating the various activities related to attestations; they do not infer or require a specific type of proof format or material be used within them.</p>
<p>Note that each Action returns only a status of whether the Action was successfully (or not) transmitted. The result of processing the request is conveyed to the caller via a subsequent Action.</p>
<p>The following is a description of the objects and examples that encompass their structure and properties:</p>
