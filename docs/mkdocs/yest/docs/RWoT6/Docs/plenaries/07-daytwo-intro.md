# Day Two Rebooting the Web of Trust Intro

We had some good interactions at the dinner last night, which allowed
different groups to come together and further cross-fertilize some of
the papers we're working on.

Today is a work day.

## The Future

The group is being formalized as a LLC with a board of directors:
Christopher, Joe, Manu, Kim, Heather

The first board of directors meeting is at lunch today.

## Creative Briefs

A creative brief is being handed out, which will help people to focus their briefs.

It has five questions.

1. What's the goal?
2. Who is the audience?
3. How will the paper change its readers?
4. What are the key sections in the paper? Key points that need to be made?
5. What are the project deliverables?
