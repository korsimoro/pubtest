# Subject: Second #RebootingWebOfTrust Design Workshop to follow United Nations ID2020 Summit on May 21st & 22nd

Our second #RebootingWebOfTrust Design Workshop on decentralized identity technologies will be held the [weekend of May 21st and 22nd](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/id-2020-design-workshop-tickets-24611080404) in New York City. This date was selected to follow an important digital identity policy event at the United Nations. 

The day before, on the 20th of May, the non-profit [ID 2020](http://www.id2020.org/) is organizing a conference on digital identity, inclusion and human rights in the Trusteeship Council Room of the United Nations. The [ID 2020 Summit](http://www.id2020summit.org/) will bring together industry leaders, NGOs, governments, and emerging technology experts to establish a global conversation resulting in working coalitions to address the problems around digital identity and suggest solutions. The two main goals of the UN summit are:
* by 2020, be able to create a legally valid digital identity for every last person without an identity
* by 2030 to have rolled this capability out to at least 1 billion at-risk people to make them visible and restore them into society both personally and economically

Our following two-day facilitated event will use the same format as we did for last November's [#RebootingWebOfTrust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust) event in San Francisco—our agenda will follow a similar process as described [here](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/event-documents/process/RebootingtheWebOfTrustProcess.pdf). There is a complete documentation of the previous event in the [github repository](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust), including photos, drafts, graphic output, and the [final whitepapers](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/tree/master/final-documents).

We are limiting participation in the #ID2020DesignWorkshop to a small group of people that can contribute technical knowledge and/or other substantial experience in the web-of-trust and decentralized technologies. It is intended for developers, cryptographers, researchers, user-experience designers, and policy experts who are actively involved in building the current infrastructure of tools. In particular, we'd like to have more experts to help identify technology requirements for identity use cases, as well as bring expertise with identity UX and UI.

Anticipated Workshop Outcomes
* Collaboratively create at least technical white papers or specifications on topics that will have the greatest impact on the future, and align with the identity needs of the world.
* Showcase the scope of use cases and requirements for decentralized identity and trust
* Explore developing tools that might be useful to funders and researchers
* Discuss and suggest approaches to drive adoption of these technologies

It is important to us to bring talent, diversity and championship so we would like to ask you to participate. 

All invitees will be asked to write up a 1 or 2 page “advanced reading” topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:
	•	A specific decentralized identity use case related to the topic of the UN ID 2020 Summit
	•	A specific problem that you'd like to solve with a decentralized or web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (pgp or ca-based pki) can't address the problem
	•	A specific solution related to the decentralized identity or web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to.

For examples of "advance readings" see the ones submitted for our last event [here](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/tree/master/topics-and-advance-readings). If the advance reading is accepted there is an optional reduced charge of $100 for participation in this event.

The steering committee for this event is:
	•	Christopher Allen /[Principal Architect,  Blockstream;  co-author TLS;  @ChristopherA/]
	•	Drummond Reed /[Respect Network, OASIS XDI Technical Committee, @drummondreed/]
	•	Juan Benet /[IPFS, Protocol Labs, @juanbenet/]
	•	Kiara Robles /[Creator of blockchainMe, @anarchoass/]
	•	Kaliya “Identity Woman” Young /[Co-founder of The Internet Identity Workshop; Independent advocate for digital identity; @identitywoman/]
	•	Marta Piekarska /[Security Architect, Blockstream; Lead Architect on the Future of Mobile Privacy at Deutsche Telekom; PhD candidate at Technical University of Berlin/]

Current sponsors of this event are [ID2020](http://id2020.org/), [Blockstream](http://blockstream.com/), and [Evernym](http://evernym.com/).

We are seeking additional sponsors if your organization is interested. In particular, we would love someone to sponsor an open-to-the-public party on Saturday evening at our event space, for which we do not currently have funding.

Tickets are available on [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/id-2020-design-workshop-tickets-24611080404), a current list of Confirmed Participants is at [www.WebOfTrust.info](http://www.weboftrust.info/). 

We look forward to collaborating with you!
