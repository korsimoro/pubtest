    <h1 id="day-two-demos-of-interesting-topics">Day Two: Demos of Interesting Topics</h1>
<h2 id="decentralized-vaccination-registry-using-ipid">Decentralized Vaccination Registry Using IPID</h2>
<p>DID atop of IPFS using IPNS, called IPID.</p>
<p>A DPKI that allows direct communication between patient and doctor.</p>
<p>Gives Verifiable Claims for vaccination records on a self-sovereign identity!</p>
<p>Works today! Still needs some selective disclosure!</p>
<h2 id="did-client">DID Client</h2>
<p>Command-line application that creates DIDs, rotates keys, etc. It's meant to be ledger-agnostic.</p>
<h2 id="credential-handler-api">Credential Handler API</h2>
<p>A polyfill for web browsers. Allows user to authorize credentials being sent to repository and later authorize sending them out.</p>
<h2 id="uport">Uport</h2>
<p>Digital identity for the city of Zug to get a residence permit.</p>
<p>Uport is used to scan QR codes for verifiable claims.</p>
<p><em>This shows how those credentials supported by the Credential Handler API can actually be used!</em></p>
<h2 id="btcr-tx-conversion-playground">BTCR TX Conversion Playground</h2>
<p>Results of the BTCR hackathon, where BTRC is a DID method for the Bitcoin blockchain. It converts txids to txrefs for use by BTRC DIDs.</p>
<p>Transactions aren't good enough because they're not necessarily confirmed on blockchain, so instead of txid for BTRC DIDs, we use txref, which is confirmed. They're from BIP 136. Error-correcting and censorship-resistance.</p>
<p>An OP_RETURN then points to DID Object. That's what contains most of the information; it can even act as a source-of-authority for other identities!</p>
<p>In BTRC DIDs, you can revoke just by spending the funds referenced by the txref. If you put an OP_RETURN in the new transaction, then it's update! </p>
<p><i>Next up: schema! Currently based on schema.org, but might need additional keys.</i></p>
<h2 id="dif-universal-resolver">DIF Universal Resolver</h2>
<p>Pass in an identifier under any DID method, and it'll spit out the results!</p>
<p>The driver and docker container dynamically assembles DDO Objects for you!
Some simpler methods might simply allow direct access to DDO.</p>
<p><em>Already have sample code that works on BTRC, Sovrin, and V1!</em></p>
<p>Also working on universal registration.</p>
<h2 id="did-iot-blockchains">DID + IOT + BLockchains</h2>
<p>Connecting blockchains to IoT devices, using DiDs.</p>
<ul>
<li>User DID Controlled Device DIDs</li>
<li>Signed Messages </li>
<li>Inter-Blockchain referencing as BigChainDB base</li>
<li>Enforced Create/Write access on BigchainDB assets</li>
</ul>
<p>Chips allow signing on devices, with on-board key-pairs.</p>
<p>Send a simple request to an API, get a response with a DID on blockchain, user becomes guardian of the Thing.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>We'd love to see these demos interoperating by the next Web of Trust.</p>
<p>Maybe a Hackathon before Consensus in late May.</p>
<p>We'd love to increasingly do claims, not just DIDs.</p>
