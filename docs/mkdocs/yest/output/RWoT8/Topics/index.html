<h2 id="topics-advance-readings">Topics &amp; Advance Readings</h2>
<p>In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:</p>
<ul>
<li>A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?</li>
<li>A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To add a paper, create a pull request to this repo with your contribution (preferably .md file or PDF), along with updates to the README.md in this folder and at the top of the repo with a link to your paper and your name. Please also include a byline with contact information in the paper itself.</p>

The method relies on quantifying attention flows between identities. It is predicated on the fact that attention is a basic element of all cognitive processes. It is also limited and therefore is a natural source of scarcity.</li>

<p>"Since data is becoming a key measure of whether a company will remain relevant through the digital revolution (Opher et. al., 2016), new approaches and business models are required to meet the needs of the changing marketplace (Opher et. al., 2016). To address these increasing data value issues, a number of data-value models and frameworks are emerging, including: Data as Labor; Data as Property; Data Commons; and Open Data. This paper explores the aforementioned frameworks in the context of the emerging human-centred data economy."</p>

  An additional goal was defining a threat model, to understand which aspects could be handled by the system, and which must be addressed by other systems. ...
  Our concern is that an effective digital credentialing ecosystem would make fraud within an issuing organization more appealing, so our final goal of this paper is to raise awareness among the broader SSI community."</li>

In addition to that and estimate of the World Bank states that 1 Billion of people are without a formal identity.

<p>"With Verifiable Credentials it is important to ask the question what are we expecting the issuer, the holder, and / or the verifier to do? While still making it simple enough for all the users and keeping the needed level of trustworthiness. Sharing is what provides the end value for both the verifying and the sharing party. If there is no sharing, the issuance of the VC has gone to waste. Hence if we are to provide value for the sharing party today, we have to ask the questions of where is this adopted, how can we make this adoption effortless? Can we put most of the work on the service providers? Is the user or another service expected to install software? If so, install software where? Is that software domain-specific or integrated with some existing software?"</p>
