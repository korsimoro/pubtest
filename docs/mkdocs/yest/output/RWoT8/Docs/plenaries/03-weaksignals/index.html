    <h1 id="weak-signals">Weak Signals</h1>
<p>So far, we've discussed the strong signals, but there are also weak
signals that we want to raise up to the surface. </p>
<p>We're doing this with an excercise:</p>
<p>It's 2040. You've just had a real good day. Something you've been
working on for the last 21 years in the field of digital identity has
finally come to a completion.</p>
<p>Later, you get a phone call from someone in the press reminding you
that it's the anniversary of something; what did you have to do with
it.</p>
<p>So, write up your story of what made your day in 2040 amazing.</p>
<h2 id="we-want-to-live-with-verifiable-credentials">We Want to Live with Verifiable Credentials</h2>
<p>But we really want <em>agency</em>, so that we can easily give authorization
to people, so that we can easily manage our data.</p>
<h2 id="synchronic-identity-vs-dichronic-identity">Synchronic Identity vs. Dichronic Identity</h2>
<p>Synchronic = government birth certificate. It says it's the same
individual.</p>
<p>Dichronic = different identities in different contexts for different
reasons.</p>
<p>We need to engineer for dichronic identity! So that we don't constrain
ourselves!</p>
<h2 id="cool-tech-is-not-enough">Cool Tech is Not Enough</h2>
<p>How does the advent of digital identity affect us?</p>
<p>Other ideas: being able to wipe an old identity; and not building
dystopian identity</p>
<h2 id="getting-identity-systems-to-work-together">Getting Identity Systems to Work Together</h2>
<p>But you have to step up a level, and talk about agent ecosystem, and
how you ensure that it works as intended.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-from-limitation">Freedom from Limitation</h2>
<p>You should be able to choose to participate in a decentralized or
centralized system. You should be able to move between spaces.</p>
<h2 id="digital-twins-their-rights">Digital Twins &amp; Their Rights</h2>
<p>The synthesized concepts:
* Need our actions to be seamless. 
* Need to think about ecological bottom line.
* Need to be able to verify content.</p>
<p>As we move into world of connected digital twin, we need different
rights and laws.</p>
<h2 id="will-this-technology-get-to-the-point-where-we-can-ignore-tech-details">Will This Technology Get to The Point Where We Can Ignore Tech Details?</h2>
<p>Can this allow us to move past fiscal capitalism</p>
<h2 id="can-this-be-deployed-in-balanced-fashion">Can This Be Deployed in Balanced Fashion?</h2>
<p>Privacy concerns vs Regulation</p>
<h2 id="the-world-is-a-gigantic-mmorpg">The World is a Gigantic MMORPG</h2>
<p>With each person a player in their own game.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-the-digital-world-better-reflect-how-we-think-and-cooperate-natively">How Can the Digital World Better Reflect How We Think and Cooperate Natively?</h2>
<p>How do we have human-centric goals and cooperate on them?</p>
<h2 id="digital-physical-merge">Digital &amp; Physical Merge</h2>
<p>Augmented reality becomes the way that these two worlds communicate</p>
<h2 id="social-key-recovery">Social Key Recovery</h2>
<p>Keeping private keys private and not losing them is a really hard problem!</p>
<h2 id="poly-decentric">Poly-decentric</h2>
<p>We can freely exit networks, but is there a corresponding right to
freely enter after having exited?</p>
<p>We need to formalize these rights!</p>
<p>A shared need for proactive goverrnance.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-freedom-to-exit-digital-society">Is There a Freedom to Exit Digital Society?</h2>
<p>Autonomy &amp; right-to-opt-out.</p>
<h2 id="counterrevokedelete-negative-credentials">Counter/revoke/delete Negative Credentials</h2>
<p>Is there a way to counter bad credentials: a right to be forgiven?</p>
<h2 id="being-able-to-use-identities-in-the-real-world">Being Able to Use Identities in the Real World</h2>
<p>Having the legal right to have DID, not being forced to have a
government-identity.</p>
<h2 id="oh-my-god-quantum-computing-actually-works">Oh My God! Quantum Computing Actually Works!</h2>
<p>How to build a quantum-resistant DID</p>
<h2 id="transcendence">Transcendence</h2>
<p>Dealing with data beyond credentials, survivng chaos, going beyond
physical boundaries, and having agency</p>
<p>Unique ideas:
* Personal agents
* Unfettered human connections</p>
<h2 id="different-compatible-ideas">Different + Compatible Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Young people can make mistakes</li>
<li>Shift in topology of communication could lead people back to countryside</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-big-commonalities">The Big Commonalities</h1>
<p>Some things that emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right to Forgiveness / Opt-Out</li>
<li>Look Backward to See Forward?<ul>
<li>Branding and Scarlet Letter were old problems like this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How Do We Have Dignity at Scale?</li>
<li>That is, how do we get rid of trolls online?</li>
<li>How to Use DIDs and VCs for Humans to Cooperate?</li>
<li>Agent Capabilities &amp; Delegating Responsibilities</li>
<li>Collective vs. Collaborative Intelligence</li>
<li>Take Care &amp; Think About What We're Doing</li>
<li>Where Is the Locus of Control?</li>
</ul>
