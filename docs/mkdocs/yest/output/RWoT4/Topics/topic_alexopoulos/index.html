<h2 id="security-needs-trust">Security needs trust</h2>
<p>Many cryptographic and security-critical systems implicitly or explicitly depend on a notion of
trust towards entities and devices. Some of the applications of these systems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Access Control</li>
<li>Secure Service Provision (aka reputation systems for marketplaces etc.)</li>
<li>Secure Routing</li>
<li>Collaborative Intrusion Detection, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Probabilistic trust values (belief theory - subjective logic) can be calculated and propagated through the network.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology (or Open Distributed Ledgers in general - ODLs as we like
to call them)
cannot alleviate the need for trust in entities altogether, but can help secure these
trust infrastructures.</p>
<h2 id="trust-needs-security-and-privacy">Trust needs security (and Privacy)</h2>
<p>Trust infrastructures need to be secure against threats and single points of
failure. Transparency and global synchronization can offer a lot to
a variety of problems. First, e.g. concerning a PKI, registering an identity
as a global identifier is not enough. As suggested in the DPKI paper of the
first design workshop, ODLs can offer increased security in this domain.
However, a web of trust is still needed to authenticate the identity and
the attributes associated with an entity, e.g. for use in a distributed
attribute-based access control schema. Smart contracts could also be used
to encode access-control rules.</p>
<p>Privacy is also a major challenge and solutions need to be identified.
Privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies like Zerocash (also related Zerocoin and Pinocchio Coin) and Monero can offer
insights to the techniques that can contribute to this goal (ZK proofs, ring signatures etc.).</p>
<p>Challenges like the choice of blockchain, thin clients etc. are also prevalent
as in most similar designs. Formalization is also something generally
missing.</p>
<h2 id="towards-a-multipurpose-trust-infrastructure-for-security">Towards a multipurpose trust infrastructure for security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide the ability to store directed probabilistic trust assessments
in ODLs, forming webs of trust</li>
<li>Investigate and analyze security implications of using ODLs</li>
<li>Calibrate overhead with security guarantees</li>
<li>What kind of ODL? Bitcoin-based, ethereum, new altcoin?</li>
<li>Privacy? Selective disclosure of attributes and credentials?</li>
</ul>
