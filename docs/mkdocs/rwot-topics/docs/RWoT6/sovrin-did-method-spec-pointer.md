# Sovrin DID Method Spec Pointer

The Sovrin DID Method Specification is published by the [Sovrin Foundation](https://www.sovrin.org/) in the [Sovrin github repository](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin). 

As of the start of the Fall 2018 Rebooting the Web of Trust conference (6 March 2018), [the current version of the Sovrin DID Method Specification](https://github.com/mikelodder7/sovrin/blob/master/spec/did-method-spec-template.html) is currently in a fork maintained by Mike Lodder as the lead author. We expect this fork to be merged back into the Sovrin master shortly.
