<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p>Biometrics are widely used for identity proofing, identity
verification and authentication, but many implementations are
vulnerable to breaches and exploitation. For example, centralized
repositories of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII),
including biometric data, can associate such information with other
identity information in violation of privacy and cybersecurity
guidelines.  Such respositories include public and private blockchains
that should never be used to store full, partial, or encrypted
biometric data.  This paper describes some of the best practices of
decentralized solutions, such as self-sovereign identity, that can
help solve many of the problems with biometric privacy and provide
better overall security.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Biometric data is a third rail for many discussions about
identity. It’s broadly understood to be both permanent and sensitive,
so there’s a value fear is that if the data is put online, it will
inevitably be stolen and abused.</p>
<p>There is the potential for disaster.</p>
<p>Despite this fear, biometric data already exists, and it’s already
being recorded digitally and includes embedded devices <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/03/17/sydney-biohacker-fined-implanting-travel-card-chip-hand/">^16</a>. We need
to discuss it, or other people will determine the future of biometric
data, how it will be recorded, stored, and used.</p>
<p>And the likelihood is, they will do so <em>badly</em>.</p>
<p>Good usage of biometric data should focus on privacy, security, and
scalability. The subject of the data should be able to determine how it’s
used, and they should good confidence that it will be protected, and
they should be able to use it as part of a system that could support
data from over 7 billion people.</p>
<p>Trying to meet all of these requirements might seem daunting, but
there’s already a philosophy for identity that advocates these same
needs: self-sovereign identity<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">^1</a>. Christopher Allen’s “The Path to
Self-Sovereign Identity” proposes ten principles for self-sovereign
identity, and many of them are directly translatable to the needs for
private, secure, and scalable biometrics. Biometrics, like
self-sovereign identity, require: <em>control</em>, <em>access</em>, <em>persistence</em>,
<em>portability</em>, <em>interoperability</em>, <em>consent</em>, <em>minimalization</em>, and
<em>protection</em>.</p>
<p>To meet these needs, biometric data can be split in two, divided between
an <em>identifier</em>, which recognizes, remembers, and relates to an
identity, and <em>data</em>, which contains the actual biometric information.</p>
<p>Adopting self-sovereign principles for biometric data requires a new
framework. This paper lays them out as six <em>principles</em> that are
needed for the safe storage and usage of biometric data.</p>
<h3 id="principle-1-biometrics-should-be-decentralized">Principle 1: Biometrics Should Be Decentralized</h3>
<p>When biometrics for authentication were first developed, the only
option to store the biometric data for comparison with the login data
was in a centralized silo connected to the internet. As time has gone
by, centralized silos have become more and more vulnerable, presenting
irresistible targets for data thieves.  In function identity <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">^14</a>
terms, centralized systems have one secure point for multiple records:</p>
<p><img alt="Alt" src="../Biometric-diagrams/centralized.dot.svg" /></p>
<p>This presents a single point of failure and a large attack surface.
In contrast, decentralization protects records individually and
presents a small attack surface:</p>
<p><img alt="Alt" src="../Biometric-diagrams/decentralized.dot.svg" /></p>
<p>There are a number of cases where significant collections of very
personal data have been hacked. In the United States, Equifax lost the
financial information of 143 million people<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/business/equifax-cyberattack.html">^2</a>, while the Office of
Personnel Management lost private information for 21.5 million
people<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/07/09/hack-of-security-clearance-system-affected-21-5-million-people-federal-authorities-say/?utm\_term=.e5301c5c6f53">^3</a>. And biometric data has already been endangered: AADHAR has
suffered various breaches<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html">^4</a>.</p>
<p>As new data technologies and architectures have emerged, many have
thought that there might be some role for the Blockchain for Biometrics.</p>
<h3 id="principle-2-biometrics-should-never-be-stored-on-a-blockchain">Principle 2: Biometrics Should Never Be Stored on a Blockchain</h3>
<p>Blockchains are one of the most popular and well-tested decentralized
tools for storing data on the internet. They have already become a prime
target for biometric storage. However, they should not used for this
purpose.</p>
<p>Storing biometric data on the blockchain is dangerous for two reasons.
First, blockchains are immutable: any biometric data placed on a
blockchain will be there forever. Second, blockchains are public: any
data placed on a blockchain is visible to everyone on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Blockchain data can be made less public using a few different methods. A
blockchain can be private, accessible only to a particularly group or
organization. In addition, data on a blockchain can be encrypted, making
it available only to people holding a specific secret. Unfortunately,
each of these protections is likely to eventually be defeated. A
disgruntled community member could make a private blockchain public; and
encryption is likely to eventually be broken, as technology is always
evolving. In other words, any data put on a blockchain is likely to
become fully public at some point in the future, and that is an
unacceptable result for data that is as sensitive as biometric data.</p>
<p>Though data should not be placed on the blockchain, that doesn’t mean
that blockchains can’t be used. They’re a great decentralized tool, and
there are ways to use them than don’t store biometric data on the
blockchain itself.</p>
<h3 id="principle-3-biometrics-can-be-accessed-via-a-blockchain">Principle 3: Biometrics Can Be Accessed <em>Via</em> a Blockchain</h3>
<p>If you need to store biometric data, you can store a <strong><em>pointer</em></strong> to it
on a blockchain but not the data itself. Biometric data always needs to
be secure and under your control. For example, a mobile device is
currently a popular platform for storing biometric data due to the
available hardware locks (e.g., a TPM) and the fact that you physically
possess the device. Your device is assigned several public addresses
(e.g., IP, phone, device id) but biometric data on the device is
supposed to be accessible only by explicit consent.</p>
<p>Biometric data is private, not secret <a href="https://medium.com/karana/public-private-and-secret-information-f857f3931f6b">^5</a>. A password is a secret and
should never be shared by definition. Your biometrics are private
because you must consent to share them on each use. Like a house, your
address is public but your possessions inside the house are private
under lock and key. Only by explicit consent should anyone be granted
permission to enter your house because that implies access to your
private possessions.</p>
<p>In the near future, cloud storage will be private as well including
sensitive information like your biometrics and medical records. This
private data should be secure (both legally and technologically with
locks and encryption). You may need to share this private data, but only
under explicit consent. The keys to your house give you control to
access even though the address is public.</p>
<h3 id="principle-4-biometrics-should-be-under-a-users-control">Principle 4: Biometrics Should Be Under A User’s Control</h3>
<p>When a user decides where to place his actual biometric data, he should
ensure that it stays under his control: he should be the authority who
determines who can access his data, which data they can access, and
which capabilities they have. He should also have the authority and
ability to move his data as he sees fit. In other words, his
relationship with his biometric data should adopt many of the rules of
self-sovereignty.</p>
<p>This requirement does not enforce any specific physical implementation.
Currently, many people are advocating storing biometrics on mobile
devices, but there is no guarantee that personal electronic devices will
remain common in the future; a model of ubiquitous, shared electronic
devices is equally possible. When considering the ability to control his
biometric data, a user might consider many other options, including
cloud storage. Microsoft’s Identity Hubs<a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-rising-tide-of-decentralized-identity-2e163e4ec663">^6</a> and Blockstack’s Gaia
Storage<a href="https://blockstack.org/whitepaper.pdf">^7</a> may both be viable options. Besides deciding where their
data will be stored, users may also make decisions about <em>what</em> control
entails, as some particular storage solutions might reduce control, but
only by their ultimate decision.</p>
<p>Supporting total user control maximizes the chances that a user will be
able to constantly access and protect his data, even over a very large
span of time. It allows the user to ensure that his data storage matches
the previous criteria for biometric storage: that it’s not centralized
and that it’s not stored on a blockchain. It also allows them to make
important privacy decisions, such as whether their biometric data
remains accessible in the future.</p>
<p>The largest challenge with user control of biometric data is that it may
not be protected legally. This is a topic that will need to be addressed
legally with new data sovereignty rules: data needs to be protected by
property laws, to ensure that a user’s ability to control access and
capabilities for his data remains intact.</p>
<p>With biometric storage (at last) stored in a way that maximizes
protection and authority for the user, the next question is: <em>how do you
use it?</em></p>
<h3 id="principle-5-biometrics-traits-should-be-reliable">Principle 5: Biometrics Traits Should Be Reliable</h3>
<p>Not just any biometrics will do the job. When choosing which biometrics
will be stored and used, care should be taken to ensure that the
biometrics are reliable. Biometrics are not passwords <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3796577/technology-insight-biometric-authentication">^15</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This point is not widely known, which leads to some very common misconceptions. For example, a common criticism of biometric authentication is, say, "You can't reset a fingerprint." But this is based on the mistaken notion that the biometric data is just a kind of password or token, and overlooks the importance of live presentation of the fingerprint. In a robust fingerprint method, it shouldn't matter that an attacker can present a facsimile of a person's fingerprint; anything other than the person's actual finger (still attached to his or her living body) should not work <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3796577/technology-insight-biometric-authentication">^15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a problem for two reasons. First, some biometrics are less
reliable than others <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1262027">^8</a>. For example, fingerprints and iris scans
are very different than face and voice scans. Second, there’s more
opportunity to spoof some biometrics than others: Googling a picture
of someone is easy while lifting a fingerprint is harder; and
producing a fake image of someone is easy while producing a fake
finger is harder.  Circumvention which refers to the ease with which
the trait of an individual can be imitated using artifacts (e.g., fake
fingers), in the case of physical traits, and mimicry, in the case of
behavioral traits (e.g., voice). These spoof attacks are referred to
as presentation attacks in first ISO standard related to these
attacks, ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/53227.html">^10</a>. NIST’s SOFA metrics provide more
details on these problems and possible attacks <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SOFA/SOFA.html">^9</a>.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that any biometric is necessarily superior, let alone
perfect. Instead, biometrics need to be selected that are reliable in
relation to the specific application that they’re being used for.</p>
<p>And even with that, biometrics might not be quite enough ...</p>
<h3 id="principle-6-biometrics-should-be-part-of-a-systematic-procedure">Principle 6: Biometrics Should Be Part of a Systematic Procedure</h3>
<p>Biometrics aren’t the end-all and be-all. They need to be part of a
larger systematic procedure. There are a number of possible steps for a
biometric system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Biometrics can have passive liveness (such as an Apple face
recognition), or a more extensive system can require active liveness
(such as lip-reading a person’s face when they specified words), to
facilitate presentation attack detection (PAD).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biometrics can combine multiple factors, such as requiring a
passphrase in addition to biometrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biometrics can produce confidence ratings; rather than offering a
binary result, they can suggest how likely a result is to be accurate,
based on the reliability of the biometric trait for the purpose and
the use of other systematic elements such as active liveness and
multiple factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biometrics can have fallbacks. If either the measurement device or
the person suffers a temporary or permanent change (such as a scar, a
lost finger, or a broken phone), then the biometric system should
permit other means of access.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The need for these more in-depth systems is a fact that’s already been
stated: no biometric is perfect. This means that any system will
suffer from False Rejection Rate (FRR) and False Acceptance Rate
(FAR): the right users may be rejected and the wrong users may be
accepted.</p>
<p>Systematic approaches can be actively aware of these challenges and
compensate for them.</p>
<h3 id="did-auth-flows-with-biometrics">DID Auth flows with biometrics</h3>
<p>We illustrate several DID Auth examples using <em>biometric-based</em>
identity credentials that reflect these six principles.  These
examples are based on flows found in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/DID%20Auth:%20Scope%2C%20Formats%2C%20and%20Protocols.md#example-flow-1">^19</a>.  In all cases, however,
biometric authentication first requires enrollment (or registration)
in which an Intial Biometric Vector (IBV) is collected and stored.  An
IBV is a <em>template</em> and is independent of biometric modality:
fingerprint, voice, face, etc. but contains data in standards-based or
proprietary formats.  During subsequent authentication sessions, a
Candidate Biometric Vector (CBV) is collected and "matched" against an
enrolled IBV using methods specific to the biometric modality and
format of the CBV and IBV.</p>

<p>We examine two protocols <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/eu/files/2017/06/Mobile-Biometrics-in-Financial-Services_A-Five-Factor-Framework-compressed3.pdf">^18</a>, IEEE 2410-2017 (BOPS) and FIDO (UAF
and WebAuthN), in which a public-private key pair is generated during
enrollment and biometric authentication is only used to protect access
to the private key.  Both protocols define standards for collecting
and securing biometrics on mobile devices and negotiating with relying
party servers.  We consider 4 uses cases (A,B,C and D) as a
combination of (1) where biometric data is either stored on a mobile
device or server and (2) where the authentication match occurs on the
mobile device or server for both protocols.</p>
<h4 id="enrollment">Enrollment</h4>
<p>The following sequence diagram generalizes DID-based biometric
enrollment for all flows (A,B,C, D).  First, the subject is prompted
to enroll via one or more biometric presentations (e.g., fingerprint,
face, voice).  Depending on protocol and configuration, the mobile
device or server generates a public-private key pair and reserves the
IBV (step 1).  Next, the server generates a DID for the enrolled key
pair and populates a corresponding DID Document with the public key on
a given blockchain as per server configured DID methods.  The
generated DID is associated with the public-private key pair and
returned to the subject's mobile device.</p>
<h4 id="biometric-did-auth-flow-a-mobile-store-and-mobile-match">Biometric DID Auth Flow A: mobile store and mobile match</h4>
<p>In this flow, the IBV is stored on the mobile device, typically with
the assistance of a TPM, such as iOS Secure Enclave.  This is a
typical flow for hardware-specific biometrics, like TouchId and FaceID
on iOS devices, where biometric data is never transmitted.</p>
<h4 id="biometric-did-auth-flow-b-mobile-store-and-server-match">Biometric DID Auth Flow B: mobile store and server match</h4>
<p>In this flow, the IBV is stored on the mobile device but is
transmitted to a server for match along with a CBV.  This is a typical
use case for <em>voice</em> biometrics where voice CBV samples</p>
<h4 id="biometric-did-auth-flow-c-server-store-and-mobile-match">Biometric DID Auth Flow C: server store and mobile match</h4>
<p>In this flow, the IBV is stored on the server and typically
encrypted-at-rest (with the assistance of an optional HSM and/or an
AFIS-compliant database.  Upon authentication, the IBV is transmitted
to the mobile device for match along with a CBV.  This is a typical
