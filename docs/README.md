title: Unpublished Example
description: not necessary, but on a published site this text will appear in the link preview on social media, and google search too I think
published: false
permalink: unpublished-example/
redirect_from: #can add this plugin for a finished site will be good to have re-directs for when anything changes
image: someimage.png  # again important for social media sharing.. which is really valuable for a finished product.

# Welcome to pubtest

In our main [README.md](../README.md) you'll find the project outline.

This readme will be more about how to operate this web-theme.

The idea is, once set up.. it's rather simple to add and edit content, by following some basic guidelines.


when using minimal mistakes, it's best to use the _pages directory for any pages that exist independently..

as in, they are not part of a collection, or a dated blog post... for our puposes, and to start.. basically every page belongs in this directory (being published with minimalmistakes anyway).


I marked out some useful frontmatter examples, that you'll need to view this page raw, if you are viewing through github.


and they need a permalink in the frontmatter.

also note that .md files are treated differently by jekyll than html... I still need to work out the exact difference, but they are different, I just can't remember specific. 

also, using a title will create a header for the page, and populate appropriate seo metadata.

this is rough, but better than having a minimal mistakes readme that doesn't match our project.
