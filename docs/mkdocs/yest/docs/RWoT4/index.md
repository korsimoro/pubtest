## Rebooting the Web of Trust IV: Paris (April 2017)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT4, the fourth Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which ran in Paris, France, on April 19th-21st, 2017. The goal of the workshop was to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the future.

_Please see the [Web of Trust Info website](http://www.weboftrust.info/) for more information about our community, including upcoming events._

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Please see the [Advance Readings README](Topics/) for a listing of all of the papers.

## Completed Papers

The design workshop met its goal of three to five white papers with three total.
