# Human-meaningful names for SSI
> This is a survey on the propriety of human-meaningful names for SSI.
Please either fill out the survey or provide feedback on the quality
and efectiveness of the questions.

## Motivation
In lieu of a published draft at rwot8, we have decided to dig deeper into
the historical discussion around human-meaningful naming for SSI. We have
identified and digested important papers which shape the argument. We plan
to continue to research the topic through the network of citations from the
rwot papers, the information garnered from the survey results, and interviews
with the authors and key figures within the discussion.

## Papers
Below we list the papers identified as seminal in the discussion of
human-meaningful names for SSI:
- [Secure Naming on the Blockchain][1]
- [Linked Local Names: An Overview][2]
- [Sovereign Identity Namespaces][3]
- [DID Names][4]
- [Petnames for Self Sovereign and Human Readable Identifiers][5]
- [The Political Economy of Naming][6]
- [Names: Decentralized, Secure, Human-Meaningful: Choose 2][7]
- [An Introduction to Petname Systems][8]
- [Self-Sovereign Identity Framework/Thought Model][9]

## Survey
We would appreciate feedback from all attendees of rwot8, as well as past
attendees of the design workshop that would like to weigh-in. We want to
give adequate time for reflection and will leave the survey open for the
next couple of weeks. We plan to share the results with the resultant
paper. The survey can be found [here][survey].
