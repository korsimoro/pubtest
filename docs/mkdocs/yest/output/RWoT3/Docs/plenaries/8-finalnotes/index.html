    <p><em>Commitments</em>
   * Christopher A. has committed to working on a next Web of Trust, maybe in Paris, and possibility of another next year.
   * We'll be looking into creating a Kantera workgroup at IIW (Joe, Christopher, Drummond)
   * We'll also host a session on self-sovereign identity at IIW (Joe)
   * We'll have DID working draft for IIW (Drummond)
   * Drummond will be working on Trust Framework for Sovereign Foundation
   * Uport Team will be implementing Verifiable Claims and DID Specification in UPort</p>
<p>There was some discussion of single-person papers that came out of these conferences, and we're proposing that we include them in our final papers if they get some casual peer review.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have some great topic papers, and we'd like to bring those to better attention, so we ask people to highlight other peoples' papers if they're great.</p>
