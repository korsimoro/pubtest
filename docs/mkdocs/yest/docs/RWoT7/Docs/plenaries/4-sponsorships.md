These may give you a chance to write a better paper. They may suggest a paper, or they may suggest things you could add to a paper.

We _want_ to write papers that connect to real needs.

## HTC

Taiwan, have white-labeled some phones.

Is part of issue where Taiwan is losing their sovereignty.

HTC Exodus is part of this work: a cryptocurrency and related phone. Will probably start as a standard Android phone, but there is possibility for this to expand.

_They have open questions:_

   1. Social Key Recovery. Are their hardware requirements? How to do?
   2. Trusted Processor. What type of APIs do you want to TrustZone?

Another phone will be low-priced and may be available in Third World.

   1. Talk to Moses; there may be a possibility to make a difference

## IPFS

A lot of people are using IPFS in their work, such as uPort, possibly BTRC.

A few requests:

   1. Would like to try and drive their hashes into standards project
      * So if you're using their technology and would like to use it elsewhere, they'd like to know.
   2. Maybe unify the way that IPFS is used in standards ways (e.g., encryption, etc)
   3. A standardized cryptographic identifier format (so that we can all reuse the same building blocks)

## Sovrin Foundation

Today, we have Centralized Digital Identity. Third-Party IDP (Federated) Identity has the same problems.

We have something better now, _multi-sourced identity_. We can each know who the other person is. We can each strongly authenticate the other person.

We're no longer thinking about cryptography, but about the same sort of relationship you have in the real world. Issue Credential -> Verify Credential.

_You're no longer an account, you're a connection._

_Trust is built through interactions over time._

But if you don't have privacy, then multi-sourced identity falls apart, because someone can reveal everything.

### Sovrin's Layers

So Sovrin works toward this with three layers:

   1. Sovrin Public Ledger [Cryptographic Trust]
   2. Agent-to-Agent Protocols [Cryptographic Trust]
   3. Credential Exchange [Human Trust]

### Trust Frameworks

A set of business, legal, and technical rules that members agree to follow in order to achieve trust.

### Low-Hanging Fruit to Work On

   1. Trust Frameworks
   2. Key Management (cross-chain, cross-compatible)
