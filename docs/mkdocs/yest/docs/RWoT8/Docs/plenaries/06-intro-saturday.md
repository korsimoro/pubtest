# Introduction: Day Two

Welcome to Day Two of RWOT8.

We begin with some far-ranging, casual discussion.

## White Space

We had ahas in our white space of the dinner last night.

* We can change the "D" in CRUD for DIDs to Deactivate.
* What does deactivation mean for Verifiable Claims?
   * For service endpoints?
* We can better define what a DID is.
* DIDs are the IP addresses of the identity layer
   * Verifiable Claims are the killer app, but what else might we see?

* Perhaps peer-to-peer DIDs suggest there should be encrypted DID Documents, encrypted by the public key of the other peer.

* We're very excited by illustrations for Joram, as we could really use help with our storytelling.

* We're talking about interop, but we're not demonstrating it. Maybe we could demo some different stacks interoping at the next RWOT?

## Terminology

We have a lot of discussion of terminology, and how we could improve
it, and what resources are already available.

Listing the disagreements over terminology is the first step!

## Legal

There was some discussion of the legal group, which was briefly
touched upon in a "cage match" session last night:

We are trying to see how to create governance at a global level,
without a government. But the code is our governance.

How can we come to a common agreement and still allow for variety?

Others would like to see an aspirational list and a problems
list. Before even a solutions list.

More generally: we need this cross-pollination from the legal folks if
we're going to be successful in what we're building.

Or perhaps: the ethics is where we should start, because it tells us
why we're doing what we're doing.

## Diversity

Diversity continues to be an issue for us, but we work toward it at
every workshop.

And it's particularly important because we're creating identity
technology that everyone will be using.

_And we're on to demos ..._
