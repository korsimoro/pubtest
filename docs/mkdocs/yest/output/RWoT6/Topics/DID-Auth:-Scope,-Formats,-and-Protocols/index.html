    <h1 id="did-auth-scope-formats-and-protocols">DID Auth: Scope, Formats, and Protocols</h1>
<p>Markus Sabadello, Danube Tech (https://danubetech.com), Vienna, March 3rd 2018</p>
<p>Now as certain base technologies for decentralized identity are becoming more mature (e.g. DIDs), this seems to be a good time to work on some of the most basic uses of these building blocks – such as using DIDs for authentication. There is broad interest from many individuals and organizations around the world in this topic.</p>
<p>This paper is intended as an overview and outline to frame the discussion about DID Auth at RWoT#6.</p>
<h1 id="scope">Scope</h1>
<p>The term DID Auth has been used for different things and is currently not really well-defined.</p>
<p>At a minimum, it should be understood as "proving control over a DID" in one way or another.</p>
<p>This can take place using a number of different formats, protocols, and flows.</p>
<p>In addition to "proving control over a DID", DID Auth could potentially also be understood more broadly as "proving something else such as possession of a credential". Or to put it another way, "control over a DID" is a special claim – the most fundamental self-asserted claim that "I am me" – that an <em>identity owner</em> would want to prove. "Proving something else such as possession of a credential" could therefore be considered an extension of basic DID Auth.</p>
<h1 id="did-auth-basics">DID Auth Basics</h1>
<p>What all variants of DID Auth have in common is that during an interaction between an <em>identity owner</em> and a <em>relying party</em>, the <em>identity owner</em> proves control over a DID.</p>
<p>This requires the following steps to be executed by the relying party:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>relying party</em> resolves the <em>identity owner's</em> DID to a DID Document.</li>
<li>The <em>relying party</em> attempts to authenticate the <em>identity owner</em> using the <code>authentication</code> object(s) found in the DID Document.</li>
<li>The <code>authentication</code> object(s) may include or reference a <code>publicKey</code> object, in cases where the <em>identity owner's</em> proof is established as a cryptographic signature.</li>
</ul>
<p>DID Auth must be understood to be extensible with regard to how an <em>identity owner</em> can prove control over a DID (not just through cryptographic signatures).</p>
<p>DID Auth must also be understood to work with multiple types of public keys.</p>
<p>Example DID Document with <code>authentication</code> and <code>publicKey</code> objects:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "authentication": [{
        "type": "RsaSignatureAuthentication2018",
        "publicKey": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1"
    }, {
        "type": "Ed25519SignatureAuthentication2018",
        "publicKey": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2"
    }],
    "publicKey": [{
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
        "owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
    }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }]
}
</code></pre>
<p>In some variants of DID Auth, an <em>identity owner's</em> proof of control over a DID is preceded by a cryptographic challenge issues by a <em>relying party</em> to an <em>identity ower</em>, and again in some variants, this challenge is delivered to the <em>identity owner</em> via a DID Auth service endpoint in the DID Document.</p>
<p>Example DID Document:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "service": {
        "type": "DidAuthService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://auth.example.com/did:example:123456789abcdefg"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the DID resolution process, it is currently assumed that a DID resolver returns an entire DID Document for a given DID. One optimization could be to define input parameters to a DID resolution process that would return not a full DID Document, but only the parts that are needed for a DID Auth process, e.g. the <code>authentication</code> and <code>publicKey</code> objects, and a DID Auth service endpoint.</p>

<h1 id="types-of-did-auth">Types of DID Auth</h1>
<p>Proving control over a DID by an <em>identity owner</em> to a <em>relying party</em> can take place using a number of different formats, protocols, and flows.</p>
<p>The following sections are an attempt to enumerate and group some of these variants.</p>
<h1 id="did-authed-channels">DID-Auth'ed Channels</h1>
<p>It is possible to establish authenticated (and potentially encrypted) communication channels between two parties that each act as both <em>identity owner</em> and <em>relying party</em>. Both parties of the channel are mutually authenticated. Establishment of such a channel takes place before any additional payloads are exchanged between the parties. In order to establish an authenticated channel, one party generally knows the endpoint for such a channel to the other party in advance, or this endpoint may be discoverable from the party's DID.</p>
<h2 id="did-tls">DID-TLS</h2>
<ul>
<li>The standard TLS X.509 certificates based on traditional hierarchical PKI are replaced by key material associated with DIDs, which are used to mutually authenticate both parties.</li>
<li>Even though the TLS standard should support this, in practice some implementations are not flexible enough to support custom logic for handling certificates.</li>
<li>A set of standards and guidelines (Open TLS) could be developed to ease adoption of DID-TLS.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="curvezmq">CurveZMQ</h2>
<ul>
<li>CurveZMQ is a protocol for mutually authenticated and encrypted channels based on Curve25519.</li>
<li>Instead of using hardcoded keys, they can be discoverable from the DIDs of the two parties.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h1 id="did-authed-isolated-messages">DID-Auth'ed Isolated Messages</h1>
<p>An isolated message outside of an established channel may include a proof by an <em>identity owner</em>.</p>
<h2 id="http-signatures">HTTP Signatures</h2>
<ul>
<li>An HTTP request or HTTP response may be signed to authenticate the sender.</li>
<li>The signatures are the same for identical messages, i.e. there is no replay protection.</li>
<li>The senders of the HTTP request and HTTP response are not authenticated in advance, only once the message is received.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>POST /api/v1/issuerservices HTTP/1.1
Host: django-devex-von-test.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca
User-Agent: curl/7.58.0

<ul>
<li>An e-mail may be signed using MIME Security and OpenPGP formats, but using key material associated with DIDs, instead of keys that are exchanged in advanced.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="did-authed-challengesresponses">DID-Auth'ed Challenges/Responses</h1>
<p>The most flexible variants of DID Auth are those where a challenge is issued by a <em>relying party</em> to an <em>identity owner</em>, who answers with a response to the <em>relying party</em>. This response proves control over a DID (e.g. with a cryptographic signature) and is linked to the challenge (e.g. with a nonce and timestamp).</p>
<p>Formats, protocols, and flows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the challenge and the response may be expressed in various formats, such as JWT, Verifiable Credentials, etc.</li>
<li>Both the challenge and the response can be delivered over a number of protocols and flows, involving e.g. JavaScript function calls, deep links, browser redirects, HTTP POSTs, push notifications, etc.</li>
<li>The <em>relying party</em> may or may not need additional protocol-specific information about the <em>identity owner</em> in order to be able to deliver the challenge (e.g. a DID Auth service endpoint). This additional protocol-specific information may be discoverable from the <em>identity owner's</em> DID.</li>
<li>The <em>identity owner</em> may or may not need additional protocol-specific information about the <em>relying party</em> in order to be able to deliver the response (e.g. a callback URL). This additional protocol-specific information may be included in the challenge, or it may be discoverable from the <em>relying party's</em> DID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Composition of components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>identity owner's</em> component that sends the response may or may not be the same component as the one that received the challenge. E.g. the challenge may be received as HTTP POST by a <strong>DID Auth service</strong>, but the response may be sent as HTTP POST by a <strong>mobile app</strong> (see Example Flow 6).</li>
<li>The <em>relying party's</em> component that receives the response may or may not be the same component as the one that sent the challenge. E.g. the challenge may be sent as deep link by a <strong>mobile web page</strong>, but the response may be received as HTTP POST by a <strong>web server</strong> (see Example Flow 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>relying party</em> may or may not know the <em>identity owner's</em> DID in advance.</li>
<li>The cryptographic challenge sent by the <em>relying party</em> to the <em>identity owner</em> may or may not itself include a proof of the <em>relying party's</em> control over a DID.</li>
<li>Once the <em>identity owner</em> receives the challenge via a component that can produce a response with a valid proof, the <em>identity owner</em> will typically have to approve this step (grant consent). Depending on the components and protocols, this approval step may be omitted in certain cases (e.g. on repeated DID Auth flows).</li>
