        <p>
            Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier intended for verifiable digital identity that is "self-sovereign", i.e., fully under the control of the entity and not dependent on a centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate
            authority. DIDs resolve to DID Documents — simple documents that contain all the metadata needed to interact with the DID. Specifically, a DID Document contains at least three things. The first is a set of mechanisms that may be used to authenticate
            as as a particular DID (e.g. public keys, pseudonymous biometric templates, etc.). The second is a set of authorization information that outlines which entities may modify the DID Document. The third is a set of service endpoints, which may
            be used to initiate trusted interactions with the entity. Each DID uses a specific DID method, defined in a separate DID method specification, to define how the DID is registered, resolved, updated, and revoked on a specific distributed ledger
            or network.

            <p>
                Conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">identity
management</a> systems are based on centralized authorities such as corporate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service">directory services</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate
authorities</a> , or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry">domain name
registries</a> . From the standpoint of cryptographic trust verification, each of these centralized authorities serves as its own
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_anchor">root of trust</a> . To make identity management work across these systems requires implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity">federated identity
management</a> .
            </p>

            <p>
                The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), sometimes referred to as blockchain technology, provides the opportunity to implement fully decentralized identity management. In this ecosystem, all entities share a common root of trust in the form
                of a globally distributed ledger (or a decentralized P2P network that provides similar capabilities).
            </p>

            <p>
                The entities are identified by decentralized identifiers (DIDs). They may authenticate via proofs (e.g. digital signatures, privacy-preserving biometrics, etc.). DIDs point to DID Documents. A DID Document contains a set of service endpoints for interacting
                with the entity. Following the dictums of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design">Privacy by Design</a> , each entity may have as many DIDs as necessary, to respect the entity’s desired separation of identities,
                personas, and contexts.
            </p>

            <p>
                To use a DID with a particular distributed ledger or network requires defining a DID method in a separate DID method specification. A DID method specifies the set of rules for how a DID is registered, resolved, updated, and revoked on that specific ledger
                or network.
            </p>

            <p>
                This design eliminates dependence on centralized registries for identifiers as well as centralized certificate authorities for key management—the standard pattern in hierarchical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI (public
key infrastructure</a> ). Because DID records are on a distributed ledger, each entity may serve as its own root authority—an architecture referred to as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">
DPKI (decentralized PKI)</a> .
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that DID methods may also be developed for identities registered in federated identity management systems. For their part, federated identity systems may add support for DIDs. This creates an interoperability bridge between the worlds of centralized,
                federated, and decentralized identity.

                <p>
                    DIDs have a foundation in URIs, so it's important to understand how the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/">clarified</a> the terms URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), URL (Uniform Resource Locator), and URN (Uniform
                    Resource Name) in September 2001. The key difference between these three categories of identifiers are:
                </p>

                <ol start="1">
                    <li>
                        URI is the term for any type of identifier used to identify a resource on the Web.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        URL is the term for any type of URI that can be resolved or de-referenced to locate a representation of a resource on the Web (e.g., Web page, file, image, etc.)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        URN is the term for a specific type of URI intended to persistently identify a resource, i.e., an identifier that will never change no matter how often the resource moves, changes names, changes owners, etc. URNs are intended to last forever.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4 id="x1.1.2-motivations-for-dids"><span class="secno">1.1.2 </span>Motivations for DIDs</h4>

                <p>
                    The growing need for decentralized identity has produced three specific requirements for a new type of URI that still fits within URI/URL/URN architecture but in a less than traditional way:
                </p>

                <ol start="1">
                    <li>
                        A URI that is persistent like a URN yet can be resolved or de-referenced to locate a resource like a URL. In essence, a DID is a URI that serves both functions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A URI that does not require a centralized authority to register, resolve, update, or revoke. The overwhelming majority of URIs today are based on DNS names or IP addresses that depend on centralized authorities for registration and ultimate control. DIDs
                        can be created and managed without any such authority.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A URI whose ownership and associated metadata, including public keys, can be cryptographically verified. Control of DIDs and DID Documents leverages the same public/private key cryptography as distributed ledgers.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <section id="the-role-of-human-friendly-identifiers">
                <h4 id="x1.1.3-the-role-of-human-friendly-identifiers"><span class="secno">1.1.3 </span>The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers</h4>

                <p>
                    DIDs achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central registration authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability. The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically produce random strings of characters
                    that have no human meaning. This demonstrates the axiom about identifiers known as
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%2527s_triangle">Zooko’s
Triangle</a> : "human-meaningful, decentralized, secure—pick any two".
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID when starting from a human-friendly identifier—a natural language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a DID owner such as a mobile telephone number, email address,
                    Twitter handle, or blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is out-of-scope for this specification.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in separate specifications that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that such specifications carefully consider: (a) the numerous security attacks based on deceiving
                    users about the true human-friendly identifier for a target entity, and (b) the privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
                </p>

            </section>

            <section id="purpose-of-this-specification">
                <h4 id="x1.1.4-purpose-of-this-specification"><span class="secno">1.1.4 </span>Purpose of This Specification</h4>

                <p>
                    The first purpose of this specification is to define the generic DID scheme and a generic set of operations on DID records that can be implemented for any distributed ledger or network capable of accepting DID records. The second purpose of this specification
                    to define the conformance requirements for a DID method specification—a separate specification that defines a specific DID scheme and specific set of DID record operations for a specific distributed ledger or network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Conceptually, the relationship of this specification and a DID method specification is similar to the relationship of the IETF generic URI specification ( <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC
3986</a> ) and a specific <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">URI
scheme</a> (such as the http: and https: schemes specified in <a href="http://www.iana.org/go/rfc7230">RFC 7230</a> ). It is also similar to the relationship of the IETF generic URN specification ( <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt">RFC 2141</a>                    ) and a specific URN namespace definition (such as the UUID URN namespace defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">RFC 4122</a> ). The difference is that a DID method specification, in addition to defining a specific
                    DID scheme, must also specify the methods for reading, writing, and revoking DID records on the network for which it is written.

            <p>
                This is an example of a DID:

                <p>
                    Following is an example of a DID Document that describes the DID above. This example assumes that the entity—the entity that controls the private keys for this identity—is authoritative for the DID Document. See section 1.3.2 for an example of a DID Document
                    created by a delegate. For the authoritative JSON-LD context definition, see Appendix B (the URL for the @context property below is just for illustration).

                        Discussions at Rebooting the Web of Trust 5 resulted in consensus to remove the <code>authorizationCapability</code> field as it is unclear whether all ledgers will find the field useful. The field will most likely be moved into
                        a DID Method specification or a separate DID Ledger Capabilities document.

                <p>
                    Following is a second example of a DID Document that describes the DID above. In this case the DID Document describes a dependent—an entity who is not currently in a position to control the private keys for this identity. This DID Document was created
                    by a delegate—a separate entity with its own DID that serves as a trustee for the dependent. Note that while this DID Document asserts a set of service endpoints, it does not yet contain a set of key descriptions because the dependent
                    does not yet have its own set of private keys.

        </p>

        <p>
            All other terms used in this specification are defined in this glossary.
        </p>

        <p>
            Blockchain. A specific type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that stores ledger entries in blocks of transactions that are grouped together and hashed into a cryptographic chain. Because this type of DLT was introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>            , the term "blockchain" is sometimes used to refer specifically to the Bitcoin ledger.
        </p>

        <p>
            Decentralized identifier (DID). A globally unique identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority because it is registered with distributed ledger technology or other form of decentralized network. The generic format of a DID is
            defined in this specification. A specific DID scheme is defined in a DID method specification.
        </p>

        <p>
            Decentralized identity management (DIDM). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">Identity
management</a> based on decentralized identifiers. DIDM extends identifier creation authority beyond the traditional roots of trust required by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500">X.500
directory services</a> , the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name
System</a> , national ID systems, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            Decentralized PKI (DPKI). Public key infrastructure based on decentralized identifiers and identity records (e.g., DID Documents) containing verifiable public key descriptions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dependent. A person, organization, or thing whose DID record is registered and maintained by a delegate because the dependent is not in a position to control the private keys. A dependent becomes an identity owner when the dependent takes control of the
            private keys.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID. Acronym for decentralized identifier.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID Document. A JSON data structure containing metadata describing a DID, including mechanisms, such as public keys and pseudonymous biometrics, that an entity can use to authenticate itself as the DID. A DID Document may also contain other
            <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing)">attributes</a> or
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity">claims</a> describing the entity.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID fragment. The portion of a DID reference that follows the first hash sign character ("#"). A DID fragment uses the same syntax as a URI fragment. See section 5.5. Note that a DID fragment <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> immediately
            follow a DID. If a DID reference includes a DID path followed by a fragment, that fragment is NOT a DID fragment.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID method. A definition of how a specific DID scheme can be implemented on a specific distributed ledger or network, including the precise method(s) by which DIDs and DID Documents can be read, written, and revoked.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID method conformance profile. A specification (or section of a specification) that defines the rules an implementer must follow in order to conform with another DID method specification. A conformance profile narrows the set of options that may be used
            in order to meet a specific implementation goal.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID method specification. The specification for a specific DID scheme and DID method that is conformant with the requirements of this specification.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID path. The portion of a DID reference that follows the first forward slash character. A DID path uses the identical syntax as a URI path. See section 5.4. Note that if a DID path is followed by a fragment, that fragment is NOT a DID fragment.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID reference. A DID plus an optional DID path or DID fragment.
        </p>

        <p>
            DID scheme. The formal syntax of a DID identifier. The generic DID scheme is defined in this specification. A DID method specification defines a specific DID scheme that works with a specific DID method.
        </p>

        <p>
            DIDM. Acronym for decentralized identity management.
        </p>

        <p>
            Distributed ledger technology (DLT). A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database">distributed
database</a> in which the various nodes use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus
protocol</a> to maintain a shared ledger in which each transaction is cryptographically signed and chained to the previous transaction. See also blockchain.
        </p>

        <p>
            DLT. Acronym for distributed ledger technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            DPKI. Acronym for decentralized PKI.
        </p>

        <p>
            Delegate. An entity who creates a DID record for a dependent who does not yet have the capacity to control the private keys. The dependent must rely on the delegate to safeguard the private keys until the dependent can assume control and become an entity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Identity owner. The natural person, party, organization, or thing whose identity is represented by a DID record and who directly controls the private keys to control that record. (Note: this specification avoids the term "user" since an entity is not
            always an individual person.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Identity record. Another name for a DID record.
        </p>

        <p>
            JSON-LD (JSON Linked Data). A method of encoding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a> using JSON. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">W3C JSON-LD 1.0
specification</a> enables object properties in a JSON document to be linked to concepts in an RDF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a> .
        </p>

        <p>
            Key description. A JSON object contained inside a DID Document that contains all the metadata necessary to use a public key or verification key. A list of standard key descriptions is included in Appendix C.
        </p>

        <p>
            RDF (Resource Description Framework). A semantic graph model defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/">W3C RDF Working Group</a> .
        </p>

        <p>
            Service endpoint. A network address at which a service operates on behalf of an entity. Examples of specific DIDM services include discovery services, authentication services, authorization services, interaction services, etc. A DIDM service endpoint

        <p>
            The foundation of DID architecture is the concept of the decentralized identifier. This concept is not new; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUIDs</a> (Universally Unique IDentifiers) were first developed
            in the 1980s and later became a standard feature of the Open Software Foundation’s
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment">Distributed
Computing Environment</a> . UUIDs achieve global uniqueness without a centralized registry service by using an algorithm that generates 128-bit values with sufficient entropy that the chance of collision are infinitesimally small. UUIDs are
            formally a URN namespace specified in
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">IETF RFC 4122</a> .
        </p>

        <p>
            A DID is similar to a UUID except: (a) it can be resolved or dereferenced to a standard resource describing the entity (a DID Document—see section 6), and (b) the DID Document may contain public key descriptions that enable cryptographic verification
            of DID ownership.

            <p>
                The generic DID scheme is a URI scheme conformant with <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986</a> . It consists of a DID followed by an optional path and/or fragment. The term DID refers only to the identifier conforming
                to the did rule in the ABNF below; when used alone, it does not include a path or fragment. A DID that may optionally include a path and/or fragment is called a DID reference.
            </p>

            <p>
                Following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234">RFC 5234</a> (which defines ALPHA as upper or lowercase A-Z).
            </p>

            <pre class="nohighlight">  did-reference      = did [ "/" did-path ] [ "#" did-fragment ]
  did                = "did:" method ":" specific-idstring

  methodchar         = %x61-7A / DIGIT
  specific-idstring  = idstring *( ":" idstring )
  idstring           = 1*idchar
  idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-"

                A DID method specification <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> define exactly one specific DID scheme identified by exactly one method name (the method rule in section 5.1). Since DIDs are intended for decentralized identity infrastructure,

            <p>
                The DID method specification for the specific DID scheme <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> specify how to generate the specific-idstring component of a DID.

            <p>
                A DID <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> be persistent and immutable, i.e., bound to an entity once and never changed (forever). Ideally a DID would be a completely abstract decentralized identifier (like a UUID) that could be
                bound to multiple underlying distributed ledgers or networks over time, thus maintaining its persistence independent of any particular ledger or network. However registering the same identifier on multiple ledgers or networks introduces
                extremely hard entityship and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types%23SOA">start-of-authority</a> (SOA) problems. It also greatly increases implementation complexity for developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                To avoid these issues, it is <em class="rfc2119" title="RECOMMENDED">RECOMMENDED</em> that DID method specifications only produce DIDs and DID methods bound to strong, stable ledgers or networks capable of making the highest level of commitment
                to persistence of the DID and DID method over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                NOTE: Although not included in this version, future versions of this specification may support a DID Document equivID property to establish verifiable equivalence relations between DID records representing the same identity owner on multiple ledgers or
                networks. Such equivalence relations can produce the practical equivalent of a single persistent abstract DID. See Future Work (section 11).

            <p>
                Authentication is the mechanism by which an entity can cryptographically prove that they are associated with a DID and DID Description. See section 9.2. Note that Authentication is separate from Authorization because an entity may wish to enable other
                entities to update the DID Document (for example, to assist with key recovery as discussed in section 6.5) without enabling them to prove ownership (and thus be able to impersonate the entity).

                <p class="">
                    Discussions at Rebooting the Web of Trust 5 resulted in consensus to remove the <code>authorizationCapability</code> field as it is unclear whether all ledgers will find the field useful. The field will most likely be moved into a
                    DID Method specification or a separate DID Ledger Capabilities document. Authorization will most likely be a DID Method-specific definition.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Authorization is the mechanism by which an entity may give itself or other entities permission to update the DID Document—for example to assist with key recovery. Note that Authorization is separate from Authentication as explained in section 6.4. This
                is particularly important for key recovery in the case of key loss, when the entity no longer has access to their keys, or key compromise, where the owner’s trusted third parties need to override malicious activity by an attacker. See
                section 9.

            </p>
            <p>
                Because the access control logic in the Authorization block must be implemented by the target distributed ledger or network, a DID method specification <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> include its own Authorization rules and
                processing logic. It is <em class="rfc2119" title="RECOMMENDED">RECOMMENDED</em> that all DID method specifications support the generic Authorization rules specified in this section. A DID method specification <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em>                add its own method-specific Authorization rules.
            </p>

            <p>
                The generic Authorization rules are:
            </p>

            <ol start="1">
                <li>
                    A DID Document <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have exactly one property named
                    <code>authorizationCapability</code> representing authorization information associated with the DID Document.

                <li>
                    The value of this property <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> be an array.

                </li>

                <li>
                    Updating the DID Document requires that the proof mechanism includes the <code>capability</code> property and the
                    <code>UpdateDidDocument</code> value.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If an authorization rule does not specify a specific proof mechanism (such as a public key ID), then an update proof verified with any credential in the <code>authenticationCredential</code> property of the DID Document dereferenced
                    from that DID <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> be considered valid for the proof mechanism.

            <p>
                In addition to publication of authentication and authorization mechanisms, the other primary purpose of a DID Document is to enable discovery of service endpoints for the entity. A service endpoint may represent any type of service the entity wishes to
                advertise, including decentralized identity management services for further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction. The rules for service endpoints are:

            NOTE TO IMPLEMENTERS: During the Implementer’s Draft stage, this section focuses on security topics that should be important in early implementations. The editors are also seeking feedback on threats and threat mitigations that should be reflected in
            this section or elsewhere in the spec. As the root identity records for decentralized identities, DIDs and DID Documents are a vital component of decentralized identity management. They are also the foundational building blocks of DPKI (decentralized
            public key infrastructure) as an augmentation to conventional X.509 certificates. As such, DIDs are designed to operate under the general Internet threat model used by many IETF standards. We assume uncompromised endpoints, but allow messages
            to be read or corrupted on the network. Protecting against an attack when a system is compromised requires external key-signing hardware. See also section 6.5 regarding key revocation and recovery. For their part, the DLTs hosting DIDs and
            DID Documents have special security properties for preventing active attacks. Their design uses public/private key cryptography to allow operation on passively monitored networks without risking compromise of private keys. This is what makes
            DID architecture and decentralized identity possible.

                9.2.1 Proving Ownership of a DID and DID Document
            </h3>

            <p>


                By itself, a verified signature on self-signed DID Document does not prove ownership of a DID. It only proves the following:


            </p>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>
                    The DID Document has not been tampered with since it was registered.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The owner of the DID Document controlled the private key used for the signature at the time the signature was generated.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>


                Proving ownership of a DID, i.e., the binding between the DID and the DID Document that describes it, requires a two step process:


            </p>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>
                    Resolving the DID to a DID Document according to its DID method specification.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Verifying that the id property of the resulting DID Document matches the DID that was resolved.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>


                It should be noted that this process proves ownership of a DID and DID Document regardless of whether the DID Document is signed.

            <h3 id="x9.2.2-proving-ownership-of-a-public-key">
                9.2.2 Proving Ownership of a Public Key
            </h3>

            <p>


                There are two methods for proving ownership of the private key corresponding to a public key description in the DID Document: static and dynamic. The static method is to sign the DID Document with the private key. This proves ownership of the private
                key at a time no later than the DID Document was registered. If the DID Document is not signed, ownership of a public key described in the DID Document may still be proven dynamically as follows:


            </p>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>
                    Send a challenge message containing a public key description from the DID Document and a nonce to an appropriate service endpoint described in the DID Document.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Verify the signature of the response message against the public key description.
                </li>
            </ol>

            </h4>

            <p>


                A DID and DID Document do not inherently carry any
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">PII</a> (personally-identifiable information). The process of binding a DID to the real-world owner of an identity using claims about the owner is out of scope
                for this specification. However this topic is the focus of the
                <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vctf/">verifiable claims</a> standardization work at the W3C (where the term "DID" originated).

            <h3 id="x7.3-authentication-service-endpoints"><span class="secno">7.3 </span>Authentication Service Endpoints</h3>

            <p>


                If a DID Document publishes a service endpoint intended for authentication or authorization of an entity (section 6.6), it is the responsibility of the service endpoint provider, entity, and/or relying party to comply with the requirements of the authentication
                protocol(s) supported at that service endpoint.

            <p>


                Non-repudiation of DIDs and DID Document updates is supported under the assumption that: (1) the entity is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see section 9.5) and (2) the entity has had adequate opportunity to revoke malicious updates according to the
                DID method's access control mechanism (section 6.5). This capability is further supported if timestamps are included (sections 6.7 and 6.8) and the target DLT system supports timestamps.

            <p>


                One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a DID Document is monitoring and actively notifying the entity when there are changes. This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional username/password accounts by sending password
                reset notifications to the email addresses on file. In the case of a DID, where there is no intermediary registrar or account provider to generate the notification, the following approaches are <em class="rfc2119" title="RECOMMENDED">RECOMMENDED</em>:


            </p>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>
                    Subscriptions. If the ledger or network on which the DID is registered directly supports change notifications, this service can be offered to DID owners. Notifications may be sent directly to the relevant service endpoints listed in an existing DID.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Self-monitoring. An entity may employ its own local or online agent to periodically monitor for changes to a DID Document.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Third-party monitoring. An entity may rely on a third party monitoring service, however this introduces another vector of attack.

                In a decentralized identity architecture, there are no centralized authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore DID resolvers and other client applications <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> validate
                that keys have not expired. Since some use cases may have legitimate reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, a key expiration <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD NOT">SHOULD NOT</em> prevent any further use of the key, and implementations
                <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> attempt to update its status upon encountering it in a signature.

            <p>


                Section 7 specifies the DID operations that must be supported by a DID method specification, including revocation of a DID Document by replacing it with an updated DID Document. In general, checking for key revocation on DLT-based methods is expected
                to be handled in a manner similar to checking the balance of a cryptocurrency account on a distributed ledger: if the balance is empty, the entire DID is revoked. DID method specifications <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em>                enable support for a quorum of trusted parties to enable key recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are suggested in section 6.5, Authorization. Note that not all DID method specifications will recognize control from DIDs registered
                using other DID methods and they <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> restrict third-party control to DIDs that use the same method. Access control and key recovery in a DID method specification <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em>                also include a time lock feature to protect against key compromise by maintaining a second track of control for recovery. Further specification of this type of control is a matter for future work (see section 11.4).

            It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design to all aspects of decentralized identity architecture, because DIDs and DID Documents are—by design—administered directly by their owners. There is no registrar, hosting company,
            or other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply additional privacy safeguards. The authors of this specification have applied all seven Privacy by Design principles throughout its development. For example, privacy in this specification
            is preventative not remedial, and privacy is an embedded default. Furthermore, decentralized identity architecture by itself embodies principle #7, "Respect for user privacy—keep it user-centric." This section lists additional privacy considerations
            that implementers, delegates, and entitys should bear in mind.

                Like any type of globally unique identifier, DIDs may be used for correlation. Identity owners can mitigate this privacy risk by using pairwise unique DIDs, i.e., by sharing a different private DID for every relationship. In effect, each DID acts as a
                pseudonym. A pseudonymous DID need only be shared with more than one party when the entity explicitly authorizes correlation between those parties. If pseudonymous DIDs are the default, then the only need for a public DID—a DID published
                openly or shared with a large number of parties—is when the entity explicitly desires public identification.

                The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous DIDs are easily defeated if the data in the corresponding DID Documents can be correlated. For example, using same public key descriptions or bespoke service endpoints in multiple DID Documents can provide
                as much correlation information as using the same DID. Therefore the DID Document for a pseudonymous DID <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> also use pairwise-unique public keys and pairwise-unique service endpoints.

            <p>


                When an entity is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished. DIDs and DID methods <em class="rfc2119"
                    title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. In order to reduce
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">digital fingerprints</a> , share common settings across client implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad
                messages to standard lengths.

            <p>


                The current specification does not take a position on maximum length of a DID. The maximum interoperable URL length is currently about 2K characters. QR codes can handle about 4K characters. Clients using DIDs will be responsible for storing many DIDs,
                and some methods would be able to externalize some of their costs onto clients by relying on more complicated signature schemes or by adding state into DIDs intended for temporary use. A future version of this specification should set
                reasonable limits on DID character length to minimize externalities.

            <p>


                Including an equivalence property, such as equivID, in DID Documents whose value is an array of DIDs would allow entitys to assert two or more DIDs that represent the same entity. This capability has numerous uses, including supporting migration between
                ledgers and providing forward compatibility of existing DIDs to future DLTs. In theory, equivalent DIDs should have the same identity rights, allowing
                <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vctf/">verifiable claims</a> made against one DID to apply to equivalent DIDs. Equivalence was not included in the current specification due to the complexity of verifying equivalence across different DLTs
                and different DID methods, and also of aggregating properties of equivalent DID Documents. However equivalence should be supported in a future version of this specification.

            <p>


                Verifiable timestamps have significant utility for identity records. This is a good fit for DLTs, since most offer some type of timestamp mechanism. Despite some transactional cost, they are the most censorship-resistant transaction ordering systems in
                the world, so they are nearly ideal for DID Document timestamping. In some cases a DLT's immediate timing is approximate, however their sense of
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki%23Abstract">"median time past" (see Bitcoin BIP 113)</a> can be precisely defined. A generic DID Document timestamping mechanism could would work across all DLTs and
                might operate via a mechanism including either individual transactions or transaction batches. The generic mechanism was deemed out of scope for this version, although it may be included in a future version of this specification.

            <p>


                Section 9.7 mentions one possible clever use of time locks to recover control of a DID after a key compromise. The technique relies on an ability to override the most recent update to a DID Document with Authorization applied by an earlier version of
                the DID Document in order to defeat the attacker. This protection depends on adding a
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki%23Abstract">time lock (see Bitcoin BIP 65)</a> to protect part of the transaction chain, enabling a Authorization block to be used to recover control. We plan to add
                support for time locks in a future version of this specification.

            <p>


                Not all DLTs can support the Authorization logic in section 6.5. Therefore, in this version of the specification, all Authorization logic must be delegated to DID method specifications. A potential future solution is a
                <a href="http://www.weboftrust.info/downloads/smart-signatures.pdf">Smart Signature</a> specification that specifies the code any conformant DLT may implement to process signature control logic.

            <p>

                Although DIDs and DID Documents form a foundation for decentralized identity, they are only the first step in describing an entity. The rest of the descriptive power comes through collecting and selectively using
                <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vctf/">verifiable claims</a> . Future versions of the specification will describe in more detail how DIDs and DID Document can be integrated with—and help enable—the verifiable claims ecosystem.

                This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF graph model for expressing a DID Document. Future versions of this specification <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> specify other semantic graph formats for a DID Document,
