ICANN is centralized over the so called root namespace.  Technically anybody can create any namespace, alt-root, they want.   \r\n\r\nIn the CA world:  AFAIK Certificate Authorities are actually less centralized then DNS.  I am not aware of an equivalent to ICANN in the certificate space.  Anybody can create certificates.  The question is how you get it trusted by the entities that need/want it.  Getting it trusted by browser can be difficult and costly ... don't know if that is bad.  I think it can be argued that because it is so easy to become a CA and there is no oversight that bad actors come about more often.  This is a big problem.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/issues/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/issues/5/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/issues/5/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/issues/5/events","html_url":"https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/issues/5","id":112253687,"number":5,"title":"Problems with Namecoin","user":{"login":"ChristopherA","id":69103,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69103?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristopherA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherA/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2015-10-19T23:30:01Z","updated_at":"2015-10-31T11:13:43Z","closed_at":null,"body":"/re [code-and-file-signing.adoc #37af399](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/37af3991c206c204985449d85cc4e7dee72efa63/topics-and-advance-readings/code-and-file-signing.adoc)\r\n/cc @msgilligan\r\n\r\nI've always been uncomfortable with Namecoin for a variety of personal reasons, but ever since it was revealed that no one noticed that a [single mining pool controlling over 60% of Namecoin’s hashrate](https://forum.namecoin.info/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2354&start=10) I've been very concerned.\r\n\r\nAs further evidence of these concerns, OneName.com, who was one of the largest supporters of NameCoin, are now are now [pulling out of NameCoin and using Bitcoin instead](http://blog.onename.com/namecoin-to-bitcoin/). \r\n\r\nWhat specific features or functionality of NameCoin are you wishing to leverage?
