title: Unpublished Example
description: not necessary, but on a published site this text will appear in the link preview on social media, and google search too I think
published: false
permalink: unpublished-example/
redirect_from: #can add this plugin for a finished site will be good to have re-directs for when anything changes
image: someimage.png  # again important for social media sharing.. which is really valuable for a finished product.

when using minimal mistakes, it's best to use the _pages directory for any pages that exist independently..

I marked out some useful frontmatter examples.


as in, they are not part of a collection, or a dated blog post... for our puposes, and to start.. basically every page belongs in this directory (being published with minimalmistakes anyway).

and they need a permalink in the frontmatter.

also note that .md files are treated differently by jekyll than html... so if you include any non-html (besides front-matter) make sure the file is .md

also, using a title will create a header for the page, and populate appropriate seo metadata.
