    <p><em>DID System</em></p>
<p>The problem it's solving is persistence: want it across multiple block chains, long-term</p>
<p>Decentralized identifier
ID allocation (three numbers)
Can be used for decades (or centuries)</p>
<p>Resilient
Interoperable</p>
<p><em>Identity as Correlation</em></p>
<p>A clearer, easier way to discuss identity
We can tell stories to help people understand what this means</p>
<p>This is about process of <em>identification</em> creating identity</p>
<p><em>Prectecting Digital Identity</em> </p>
<p>User test case.</p>
<p>Self-employed street trader
Very poor, African 
- May have national ID
- But doesn't correlate to access to service
- Because those services don't exist</p>
<p>How do you prevent digital identity from being abused?
- Individual must be steward and protector
- Because cyber/physical identity are indivisible</p>
<p>This offers foundational, fundamental, transformational effects</p>
<p><em>Chainpoint / Proof-of-X</em></p>
<p>Want standards for verifiable records of proof of publication, proof of process. </p>
<p>Need ways to link together identities as the attributes change over time.</p>
<p>The point of this is that it makes attestation easier.</p>
<p><em>Identity Graphs</em></p>
<p>Creating a systems of graphs to apply to distributed identities.
Model it with a unified, abstract graph.</p>
<p>Can also model relationships with people, with govt's.</p>
<p>The goal is to better access &amp; manage stuff already out there, which is a nice
complement to self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p><em>Identity Containers</em></p>
<p>Spec identity chainers to link to blockchain IDs</p>
<p>Need to decide what to put on blockchain, and what not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Containers have ACL</li>
<li>Containers have attribute stores, attestations</li>
<li>Containers should work on distributed or cloud hardware</li>
<li>All I/O should be hardened</li>
<li>Other things than Blockchain might reference container</li>
</ul>
