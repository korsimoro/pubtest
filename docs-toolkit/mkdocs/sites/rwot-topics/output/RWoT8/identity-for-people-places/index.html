    <p><strong>Generating Actionable Intelligence with Wallets and Agents for People &amp; Places</strong></p>
<p>Venn.Agency
Sam Mathews Chase samantha@venn.agency
Joni McKervey joni@venn.agency</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to discuss building in the principals of sovereign identity systems
for places as well as people to better manage multiple stakeholders and layers of access, while
preserving both the saliency of digital information and the individual privacy and protections of
the physical world.</p>
<p>We posit that, by establishing place identity (​spatial coordinate​ tokens) and instituting
decentralized architecture for data exchange (wallets, verifiable claims, non-surveillant
networks), we can build fully functioning sovereign identity systems and inspire their adoption at
scale by organizations across multiple industries.</p>
<p>We will explore the hypothesis that generating actionable intelligence without surveillance will:
- Alleviate operational burden &amp; risk of mass data collection for the organization
- Protect the rights and sensitive personal information of employees
- Create measurable improvements in safety, efficiency, trust and communication</p>
<p>Acknowledging that there are many theoretic use cases and explorations of related solutions
and yet few projects grounded in real-world testing, we will focus on the construction of such a
system within the framework of a pilot currently under development. ​The pilot proposes to build
a local, non-surveillant system for workplace accountability, information management, access
architecture, safety auditing and training for a large-scale industrial operation. This paper will
explore the design of this system through two use cases (outlined below).</p>
<p>Areas of focus: safety training, spatial awareness, proof of knowledge, and incentivizing safety
practices that require lifestyle change like sleep and exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Use Case #1 — Establishing Spatial Identity with Coordinate Tokens</strong></p>
<p>We combine a photorealistic 3D scan of a building with its blueprints to create a digital model of
the space. This model is overlain with a grid to which coordinates are assigned.</p>
<p>Proposed actions for this model:
- A tagging system that attaches information to coordinates on the grid
- Tags may include: task assignments, reminders, warnings, permission requests, timers,
security gates, log-ins and -outs,
- Workstation or location-specific training tools and games
- An immutable ledger of interactions in the space</p>
<p>Questions to explore:
- Who are the stakeholders (eg, employee, organization, insurance brokers, government,
regulatory bodies) and how do they interact?
- How is this model deployed so that anyone who needs to can access it with the
level/layer of information relevant to them?
- How are the layers of access and control managed?
- How does a person attach a tag to the appropriate coordinates?
- How does an employee’s wallet interact with the information tagged to the grid?
- How is this model and its information backed up?
- What protocols can we create to establish Place Identity?
    - When does a Place ID get called? In what order?
    - How is a coordinate token issued?
    - How does a place use a wallet? Can that wallet represent the place
autonomously?</p>
<p><strong>Use Case #2 — Safety through Incentivized Wellness</strong></p>
<p>It's unacceptable to give raw health data to employers or any organization that isn't explicitly
caring for you medically. How can we design an identity manager that lets each user hold onto
their own health data? I'm imagining that an insurer can acknowledge 3 different sleep app data,
and 6 different heart rate monitors, these can be linked to the employee wallet, an employer
incentivizes 5 hours or more of sleep a night and cardio exercise twice a week. The employer
sends a schema overlay request to the employee wallet, the employee wallet runs the request
against the data and returns either a yes or no token.</p>
<p>Questions to explore:
- What data should be shared equally between employer and employee?
- What data should remain the employees’ only? Why?
- What data should remain the employers’ only? Why?
- What data should be shared organization-wide? Why?</p>
