<p>By Christian Lundkvist <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislundkvist">@ChrisLundkvist</a> \&lt;christian.lundkvist@consensys.net></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>If an identity is tied to a single persistent private key, then loss
or compromise of the private key will mean total loss of the
identity. Since key compromise and/or loss do happen there needs to be
a way to recover from this in order to have a persistent digital
identity. See <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/shared_terminology_for_digital_identity_systems.md">here</a> for definitions used.</p>
<h2 id="key-revocation-and-rotation">Key revocation and rotation</h2>
<p>If the user of the identity suspects that a key is or may be
compromised the user can rotate their key by submitting a new key to
the system, signed by the old key. After this the old key can be
revoked. An example of how key revocation can work in Ethereum is
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/pki_tools_in_evm_blockchains.md">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="key-loss">Key loss</h2>
<p>To deal with the case where a user completely loses control of the key
a multisig system can be put in place where the user preemptively
selects <code>N</code> "delegate" identities that are empowered to allow the key
of the identity to be changed if <code>N</code> delegates provide their
signatures. An example of this kind of key reset mechanism is
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/Key-revokation-of-lost-and-stolen-keys.md">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="timeouts-and-dealing-with-takeover-attempts">Timeouts and dealing with takeover attempts</h2>
<p>In the previous <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/Key-revokation-of-lost-and-stolen-keys.md">example</a> of a decentralized key reset
procedure a timeout was introduced where the original key can stop a
key rotation from taking place using a timeout. There can be a contest
period where the old key can stop the key rotation if the key rotation
was initiated by an attacker that had been able to access the old key.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>What are good timeout procedures to balance ease of key rotation with protection from attackers?</li>
<li>How to deal with UI/UX challenges of decentralized key recovery procedures?</li>
</ul>
