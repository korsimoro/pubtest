## Civic / Identity.com

Concerned with flaws of centralized identity.

How do we increase privacy; lower cost of verification with reusable
identity; and monetize verification (not PII)?

CIVIC offers Civic Apps and Secure Identity Platform
   * Private verification with blockchain attestations

Identity.com partners with Civic, is open-source community, and offers
on-demand, secure, accessible ID verification ecosystem
   * A marketplace where anyone can transact in identity verification services

We believe that one one company should own identity.
   * interoperability + interdependence
   * Reduce friction to verify identity

First round of open source has included smart contracts and libraries

Implementing standards like DID and Verifiable Credentials
