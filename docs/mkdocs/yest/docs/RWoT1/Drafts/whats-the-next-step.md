# Creating the New World of Trust
#### _What's Next?_

On November 3rd and 4th, the Rebuilding the Web of Trust design workshop looked at the future of decentralized trust on the internet with the goal of producing 3-5 white papers and specs. Those papers were polished for release in December, leaving the question: what's next?

Our major goal is to produce something notable for the 25th anniversary of PGP, in July 2016. This should be a working proof-of-concept that can help the Web of Trust to reach a broader audience. It should be something that's both _usable_ and _used_, it needs to be _compelling_ and _inclusive_.

If we can meet this goal, we can make our design ideas into reality.

## What We're Building

The white papers and specs produced at the design workshop are the first products of our new Web of Trust, and they can be the germ of our development going forward.

For a next step, we've highlighted some additional papers that we think could draw everything together and help to tell our story. They include an article articulating the need for a new Web of Trust, explanatory introductions for some of our existing white papers, definitions of an agreed-upon language, and possibly a few more use cases.

Beyond that, our design workshop highlighted two projects that were popular and which _could_ become a major emphasis for the group.

The first is DPKI, a decentralized PKI system that received an extensive white paper at the design workshop. Figuring out how to fund and ship it was the most popular suggestion for our next step among design workshop participants.

The second is a solution for refugee identity as discussed in "Starting from Zero", one of five use cases in the "Opportunities Created by the Web of Trust for Controlling and Leveraging Personal Data" white paper. This use case evolved to discuss the ongoing plight of Syrian refugees but has only increased in importance since the 11/13 terrorist attacks on Paris.

It might be that neither of these projects is right for 2016. The correct answer might be a subset of one of them or something else entirely. But these were the projects that received the most attention at the design workshop, making them a good starting point for discussions.

Whatever project we decide upon, we should keep in mind the following general principles:

* Building a **platform** can be both difficult and expensive, but it's also the sort of thing that you don't want in the hands of a single company, so that might be a perfect goal for an unaffiliated group of this sort.
* However, platforms won't get the public excited. For that we need a killer **app**. 
* The most successful project will probably include both a platform _and_ an app, supporting the big picture _and_ the public perception.

As we map out the topography of the new digital world, we hope to turn our Web of Trust into a whole World of Trust.

(((What is the basis of this statment? What do you/we think we mean by trust - at what scale for what purpose? )))



## The Road to 2016

The holidays make immediate movement toward 2016 goals difficult, but group hangouts in early January could support the Rebooting the Web of Trust group moving forward.

Those hangouts can also help us decide upon our next event. Possibilities include a hackathon, a workshop, another design shop, small working groups, or even fundraising events. We are committed to holding this next event in Winter 2016. As the first design workshop was held in the California Bay Area, the East Coast might be a good venue for a follow-up event, to help expand the Web of Trust group beyond the 40 or so people present in San Francisco in November.

The ultimate goal is a large get-together in July 2016, where 75 or so experts could celebrate the anniversary of PGP … and unveil the newest addition to the Web of Trust.

## Funding Questions

How to fund a winter 2016 event, any smaller events, and the creation of a compelling release for July 2016 remains an open question. VCs, donations, and grants offer the most obvious sources, but we might also be able to present pitches to the IETF, European DARPA, or even the UN.

To pursue those possibilities, we first need to decide upon our focus. Hopefully that's what the upcoming hangouts will allow. From there we can adapt and expand the early design work we've already done to create proposals or write grants … and ultimately start rebooting the Web of Trust.
