    <p>We've ended the RWOT5 with discussion of the design workshop, its challenges, and its future.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-we-improve">What Could We Improve?</h2>
<h3 id="about-the-web-site">About the Web Site?</h3>
<p>The web site could currently use better work.</p>
<h3 id="about-registration">About Registration?</h3>
<p>We went early bird this time, and it seemed to help with topic papers.</p>
<h3 id="about-space">About Space?</h3>
<p>Need space with more break-out rooms and opportunity for more quiet.</p>
<h3 id="about-monies">About Monies?</h3>
<p>Concerns over free-riding in commons, and making sure commons is paid for.
Maybe we should be asking companies building on our stuff to contribute back.</p>
<p>Options:
   * Non-profit umbrella?
   * Licensing?</p>
<p>Can contribute in other ways, like regular contributions from company, renting B&amp;B space, getting contributions for podcasts or other outputs.</p>
<p>It might be hard to get some people in because it's intimidating to produce papers or because we're putting some people out of business.</p>
<h2 id="upcoming-events">Upcoming Events.</h2>
<p><strong>IIW.</strong> #25 is October 17-19. #26 is April 2-4. Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>We'd like to get more of them involved. </p>
<p>Part of it's a different in philosophy: our goal is to produce outputs and IIW doesn't at all.</p>
<p><strong>MIT Media Lab Ai &amp; Blockchain Legal Forum</strong> is October 30-31</p>
<h2 id="related-organizations">Related Organizations</h2>
<p>Organizations and groups we can work with:</p>
<p><strong>W3C Community Group.</strong></p>
<p>Can't offer standards, but it can create a work item, get consensus, and publish for simpler things like a definition of self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p><strong>Litcoin</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sovrin Foundation</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-drive-our-agenda-forward">How Do We Drive Our Agenda Forward?</h2>
<p>We need to show how the future is quickly changing, to build the bridge to it, and to even build the rails if we can!</p>
<p><strong>General Ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A Community Asset Mapping of What Resources We Have and Who We Are Based on Those Resources.</li>
<li>Raise Bitcoins.</li>
<li>We Could Write Specs for Other People, Like Bitcoin for W3C.<ul>
<li>Or We Could Take Contributions for Other Specs or Such We're Working On. (Bounties)</li>
<li>But We Have to be Careful not to derail Our Own Work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Possible Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Hackathons</li>
<li>Face-to-Face Hackathons</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-we-missing-out-on-talking-about">What Are We Missing Out on Talking About?</h2>
<p><strong>Hyperledger.</strong> Should we be involved more? </p>
<p><strong>Facilitation.</strong> We may need to mix more and guide working groups more. (We tried to do this with primers and tradeshow this time.)</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-improve-onboarding">How Can We Improve Onboarding?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Google Docs with agenda and other information before hand, or projection.</li>
<li>One demo to lead things off.</li>
<li>Better talk About who everyone's expertise is.</li>
<li>Better timing with regard to other events.</li>
<li>Illustrations, even video clips<ul>
<li>(Problem is cost.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mentorships between existing and new members.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-will-we-next-meet">When Will We Next Meet?</h2>
<p>We might have Web of Trust Meetups to increase interest, particularly in Asia.</p>
<p>West Coast. </p>
<p>Probably San Francisco. (Maybe Vancouver? [Toni will check] Santa Barbara? [Joe A. will check]. Seattle?)
February?</p>
<p><em>We will announce at IIW.</em></p>
<p>Possible Helpers for West Coast:
   * Tim  Li Chen</p>
