# RWOT local chapters

Authors: Bohdan Andriyiv (bohdan.andriyiv@validbook.org)

Keywords: short_topic_paper_to_open_discussion, local communities, face to face meetings

IMHO, RWOT community does very interesting stuff - theoritical explorations and practical implementaions of cool things that has to do with how people cooperate, built on the new ever-appearing "hard" IT technologies 
and ever-deeper "soft" understandings (game theory, economics, evolutionary psychology).

It is great to have this community as a global phenomenon, but the lack of face-to-face regular communication decreases productivity, potential output, number of people willing to participate in it.

What if we had regular RWOT-like weekly/monthly meetings locally? Something like tech meetups, but not limited to a particular technologies. A place where people can meet and talk/explore/do cool things that has to do with human cooperation.

## Questions:
Who would participate in this meetings? How would they agree on the common topics to discuss, things to do? Is it not what is being done in academia already?
Do we need a tutorial on how to organize, conduct such meetings?
