    <h1 id="topic-papers">Topic Papers</h1>
<h2 id="table-1-a-gestalt">Table 1: A Gestalt</h2>
<p>The gestalt: Approachable and trustful technologies for ad hoc community building.</p>
<p>How can we make these identities more approachable and how can we help people to trust them?</p>
<p>How do we plug into existing government systems?</p>
<p>How do we build more lightweight ad hoc communities ourselves with some sort of legal standing?</p>
<h2 id="table-2-dids-dads">Table 2: DIDs &amp; DADs</h2>
<p>Some practical ideas for DIDs and key management.</p>
<p>Some expansion of DADs from last time.</p>
<h2 id="table-3-interoperability-conventions">Table 3: Interoperability Conventions</h2>
<p>Standard docs only get us to a certain level of interoperability. We need to use them in consistent ways across networks without having to rely on standards for everything.</p>
<p>How do we expand conventions into requirements like the GDPR</p>
<h2 id="table-4-digital-wallets">Table 4: Digital Wallets</h2>
<p>What are key attributes of wallets?
Key management, exchanging information, interoperability, data portability, does the province or state accept wallet.</p>
<p>Other questions:
Where does trust come from?
What are the big problems we need to solve?</p>
<h2 id="table-5-mental-models-pitfalls">Table 5: Mental Models &amp; Pitfalls</h2>
<p>Five mental models for identities: security, liberty, data, relationships, capability. This creates problems within groups working on identity because they're talking at cross-purposes.</p>
<p>And discussion of common pitfalls (and catastrophes!), which often arise from not understanding that you're talking about different models, because identity is a multi-dimensional model. </p>
<h2 id="table-6-did-technologies">Table 6: DID Technologies</h2>
<p>Discussion of DID technologies, working on shared principles.</p>
<h2 id="table-7-digital-twinning">Table 7: Digital Twinning</h2>
<p>We give identity to machines.
There's an intersection with proof-of-personhood.</p>
<h2 id="table-8-petnames">Table 8: Petnames</h2>
<p>Want human readable names for identities.</p>
<p>Demo of app that lets you introduce someone and suggest a name.</p>
<p>The missing aspect? CONTEXT.
Where we met someone, and in what context.</p>
<p>Instead of a top-down centralization, could have a bottom-up bubbling.</p>
