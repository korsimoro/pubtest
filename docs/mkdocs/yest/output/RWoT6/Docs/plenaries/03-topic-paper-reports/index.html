    <h1 id="topic-paper-report-outs">Topic Paper Report-Outs</h1>
<h2 id="group-1-linked-data-capabilities">Group 1: Linked Data Capabilities</h2>
<p>What is a capability?</p>
<p>A physical key is a capability</p>
<p>But wouldn't it be nice to have an electronic key, and put ability to
revoke on it, and have caveats?</p>
<p>And wouldn't it be nice to have a key that only worked for 12 months</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegation</li>
<li>Attenuation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="group-2-did-auth-pragmatics">Group 2: DID Auth &amp; Pragmatics</h2>
<p>DID AUTH. The moment when you prove you're still in control of your DID.</p>
<ul>
<li>Needs feeback from people using verifiable claims</li>
</ul>
<p>PRAGMATICS. We have been doing this for years, and not obviously
taking off on an exponential rise. We need to do something
different. A roadmap.</p>
<p>If something is not on full roadmap to adoption, users aren't seeing
the whole picture.</p>
<p>How do we grow the ecosystem without decentralization occurring from
someone nailing a feature and attracting everyone? (Email is a good
example! Chat providing is not!)</p>
<h2 id="group-3-dids-dads-data-ubi">Group 3: DIDs, Dads &amp; Data; UBI</h2>
<p>Lots of things discussed:</p>
<p>DIDs. Interoperability with what's currently available </p>
<p>DADs. Distributed autonomic data. Makes decisions for you on your behalf.</p>
<p>DATA STORAGE on the Blockchain.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>UBI. How to use cryptocurrency for basic currency</p>
<p>Technology open commons.</p>
<h2 id="group-4-did-tls-did-volume">Group 4: DID TLS &amp; DID Volume</h2>
<p>DID TLS. We want to get started on this; it'll take a while.</p>
<p>DID VOLUME. We have a procedural process that can run on any blockchain and solve
volume problem for creating DID. But you have to remove idea of
transferability.</p>
<h2 id="group-5-use-cases">Group 5: Use Cases</h2>
<p>How do you use the RWOT workshop?</p>
<p>When different use cases have different demands. Could need privacy or publicity.</p>
<p>What are the common patterns to use the data? To store the data?</p>
<p>There's a lack of clarity.</p>
<p>We should consider pushing on things that quickly go exponential.</p>
<h2 id="group-6-did-auth">Group 6: DID Auth</h2>
<p>How can we get DID auth out there and used quickly by corporations?</p>
<p>What is the path to get there?</p>
<p>Is TLS the right model to get there?</p>
<h2 id="group-7-the-implementers-group">Group 7: The Implementers Group</h2>
<p>From British Columbia &amp; Open Badges</p>
<p>British Columbia is ...</p>
<p>Working to bootstrap a self-sovereign system</p>
<p>Public, open credentials for businesses.</p>
<p>Created TheOrgBook, a central repository to place credentials</p>
<p>Overlaps with Badge world ...</p>
<p>Because with badges, you have questions of trust, where credentials are stored</p>
<h2 id="group-8-corporate-self-sovereign-identity-pgp">Group 8: Corporate Self-Sovereign Identity &amp; PGP</h2>
<p>CORP SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY. Why needed?</p>
<p>Beacause corporations cross sovereign boundaries!</p>
<p>PGP. Can we retire it?</p>
<p>BTRC is a more limited DID method focused on web of trust.</p>
<p>So what is a web of trust?</p>
<p>You are the root for a web of people that you trust!</p>
<p>And it links out from you to people you know to people they know.</p>
<p>This brings up question of PETNAMES (aka Local Names). How do you name these people as
they are further removed?</p>
