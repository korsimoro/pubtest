We've ended the RWOT5 with discussion of the design workshop, its challenges, and its future.

## What Could We Improve?

### About the Web Site?

The web site could currently use better work.

### About Registration?

We went early bird this time, and it seemed to help with topic papers.

### About Space?

Need space with more break-out rooms and opportunity for more quiet.

### About Monies?

Concerns over free-riding in commons, and making sure commons is paid for.
Maybe we should be asking companies building on our stuff to contribute back.

Options:
   * Non-profit umbrella?
   * Licensing?
   
Can contribute in other ways, like regular contributions from company, renting B&B space, getting contributions for podcasts or other outputs.

It might be hard to get some people in because it's intimidating to produce papers or because we're putting some people out of business.

## Upcoming Events.

**IIW.** #25 is October 17-19. #26 is April 2-4. Mountain View, California.

We'd like to get more of them involved. 

Part of it's a different in philosophy: our goal is to produce outputs and IIW doesn't at all.

**MIT Media Lab Ai & Blockchain Legal Forum** is October 30-31

## Related Organizations

Organizations and groups we can work with:

**W3C Community Group.**

Can't offer standards, but it can create a work item, get consensus, and publish for simpler things like a definition of self-sovereign identity.

**Bitcoin**

**Litcoin**

**The Sovrin Foundation**

## How Do We Drive Our Agenda Forward?

We need to show how the future is quickly changing, to build the bridge to it, and to even build the rails if we can!

**General Ideas:**

   * A Community Asset Mapping of What Resources We Have and Who We Are Based on Those Resources.
   * Raise Bitcoins.
   * We Could Write Specs for Other People, Like Bitcoin for W3C.
      * Or We Could Take Contributions for Other Specs or Such We're Working On. (Bounties)
      * But We Have to be Careful not to derail Our Own Work
     
**Other Possible Events:**

   * Virtual Hackathons
   * Face-to-Face Hackathons
   
## What Are We Missing Out on Talking About?

**Hyperledger.** Should we be involved more? 

**Facilitation.** We may need to mix more and guide working groups more. (We tried to do this with primers and tradeshow this time.)

### How Can We Improve Onboarding?

   * Google Docs with agenda and other information before hand, or projection.
   * One demo to lead things off.
   * Better talk About who everyone's expertise is.
   * Better timing with regard to other events.
   * Illustrations, even video clips
      * (Problem is cost.)
   * Mentorships between existing and new members.

## When Will We Next Meet?

We might have Web of Trust Meetups to increase interest, particularly in Asia.

West Coast. 

Probably San Francisco. (Maybe Vancouver? [Toni will check] Santa Barbara? [Joe A. will check]. Seattle?)
February?

_We will announce at IIW._

Possible Helpers for West Coast:
   * Tim  Li Chen
