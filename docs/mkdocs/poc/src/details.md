# Quickstart

```
git clone git@github.com:korsimoro/pubtest
cd pubtest
./toolkit/setup.sh
. ./toolkit/venv/bin/activate
tool
```

# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to develop a
publication technology with the following properties:

## community engagement
  - integrate with external data inputs (like Forms, or chats)

## machine processable rich data
  - normalize tabular data as sqlite files
  - use sql queries to generate reports
  - use graphql queries to generate reports
  - use git commit history exploration to generate reports
  - expose report data as yml, csv, and json for
    - our own consumption via \_data
    - reference data promoting distribution of machine readable data to other
      sites about data and make the results of this analysis readily digestable
      for publication purposes

## Proof of Concept - recording the exploration of mission support technologies
  - submodules - to access files from other repositories, linked to a specific point in their tracking history, which is available to us for inclusion in documentation
  - mkdocs - expected useful for some structured data and ad-hoc data sources
  - wordpress - it should be possible to do something with wordpress, but not sure what
  - sqlitebiter - helps normalize tabular data around a sqlite format
  - tool - our own shim, with whatever data transformation logic we want

## explore the use of git & github
  - issues tracking to coordinate our work and advance our ideas to completion
  - github pages for publication
  - circleci integration for CI/CD pipeline
  - use of submodules
  - use of git commit history in publication


# Git Configuration
- [CircleCI](#CircleCI Integration)
- [GitHub Pages](#CircleCI Integration)
- [branch: documentation](#CircleCI Integration)
- [branch: master](#CircleCI Integration)

## CircleCI Integration
- https://circleci.com/gh/korsimoro/pubtest/tree/documentation
- commits to 'documentation' branch will trigger the workflow in ".circleci/config.yml"

The ```.circleci/config.yml``` file associates a command with a branch name, so we can run different
commands depending upon updates to any branch.

## GitHub Pages Integration

publication to 'master' branch will trigger jekyll run and publish the result.
This is due to serving the repository via github pages.  As a result we get a
"free, well maintained, powerful" step that will process our 'master' branch,
and in particular, the 'docs' directory and publish the result for global\
visibility.

### branch: documentation
the default branch is 'documentation'.

when documentation is to be released, you should commit to this branch.  That
will trigger the circle-ci preparation step followed by the github pages
publication step.

### branch: master
ideally the 'master' branch will be controlled, and the state of master should
always match the deployed website.

This means we want to manage our updates to master as much as possible, and
refrain, as much as possible, from committing directly to master.

This effectively makes "releasing the repo" equivalent to "publishing the
documentation", which is a nice parity to have for any project!


# PoC

All of the PoC components can be ignored, but they
demonstrate the sorts of tools we should consider
within reach.

## mkdocs

everything mentioning mkdocs can be
safely ignored.  We are leaving it in
because it is working, and there are documentation
subsets for which it might be very useful.  It
does not play any role in the main deployment.

The mkdoc sandbox is visiable
at ```/pubtest/mkdocs/index.html``` when deployed.

## tool's query system

This has proven useful to me.  It is equivalent to "frozen views" in classic rdbms, but the views are written out as CSV, JSON, and YML and locked to an audit trail via the supporting git repository.

## wordpress
We could integrate with wordpress

## presentation of git commit logs
Exposing the ```chain of provenance``` of information is of critical importance in the identity-tech universe.

Since the data is ultimately *published* from git, via github pages, then it makes sense for the provenance chain to be rooted in the git commit history.  This gives you 'tree-hashes' linked to an audit trail, which can, ultimately be linked to the ecosystem of DIDs and VCs.

DIDs should be mappable to "git repository states" in a very decentralized manner.  One could even imagine a did:git:\* method ;)



# Key Directories

## docs/assets/mkdocs

These are the markdown source files for mkdocs.

## docs/mkdocs

This is what gets served vi ```/pubtest/mkdocs```

## \_data/sqlite

This contains of the following structure

      /[db-name]
        database.sqlite
        [query].sql
where the database.sqlite file a sqlite database.
This can come from any source and
- can be managed using standard SQL utilities
- can be generated as a snapshot from googlesheets
  or other CSV data via ```sqlitebiter```
- can be pulled by scraping websites via ```sqlitebiter```

## \_data/[db-name]\_[query].yml

This will
