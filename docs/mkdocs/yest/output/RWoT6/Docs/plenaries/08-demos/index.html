    <h1 id="technology-demos">Technology Demos</h1>
<h2 id="dif-universal-resolver-markus">DIF Universal Resolver (Markus)</h2>
<p>DIDs are become more mature; resolver takes you from the DID to the
DID Document.</p>
<p>Graphical interface: type a DID and it gets resolved!</p>
<p>Written in Java</p>
<p>Each DID method works a little different, and the Resolver has drivers
that work for them. Drivers can work internally in different ways.</p>
<p>The tool supports service selection (such as looking for a "homepage" service)</p>
<h3 id="an-application-of-the-universal-resolver">An Application of the Universal Resolver</h3>
<p>Adding DID-based authentication to TheOrgBook</p>
<p>Uses service-to-service APIs: only allow API requests from certain DIDs
   * Which requires a Signing DID Auth Proxy &amp; Verifying DID Auth Proxy</p>
<h2 id="practical-usage-of-did-cedric">Practical Usage of DID (Cedric)</h2>
<p>ixo Protocol manages projects &amp; their implacts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project</li>
<li>Claims</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>A user with a self-sovereign project creates a project, then another
user makes a request to submit claims, which the project owner can
authorize.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Uses Metamask as credential provider</p>
<ul>
<li>An Ethereum wallet is used for the DID</li>
<li>Takes data and adds signature</li>
</ul>
<p>Then users on mobile applications can make claims, which are also signed.</p>

<h2 id="the-orgbook-john">The OrgBook (John)</h2>
<p>Province of British Columbia</p>
<p>Solving problems for business people, by creating</p>
<p><em>Verifiable Claims</em></p>
<p>The OrgBook is a <em>Holder</em> in the middle, which stores Verifiable
Credentials about businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Business registry and permits &amp; licenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Can search by name and look up permits &amp; other credentials related to company</p>
<ul>
<li>Can "Verify Credential" to see proof of credential</li>
</ul>
<p>Public value thanks to transparency, but it's available by API to any
one else who uses the service</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be used to look up suppliers</li>
<li>Can offer recipes necessary to start up a specific type of business</li>
</ul>
<p>Uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify existence of some permits</p>
<h2 id="capturing-ratings-interviews-kulpreet">Capturing Ratings Interviews (Kulpreet)</h2>
<p>A use case for DIDs: Chlu</p>
<p>Decentralized, verifiable ratings for vendors selling services and
products on marketplaces.</p>
<p>They should be publically accessible and shared with a certain marketplace</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't hide any ratings or reviews: it's all or nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>Verification requires signatures by reviewer and marketplace and vendor</p>
<p>Gets by problems of replication of IPFS by pinning a copy immediately</p>
<p>Next Step: move to DID spec, solve problems with IPFS as a passive
store, integrate with btcd.</p>
<h2 id="javascript-did-resolver-christian">Javascript DID Resolver (Christian)</h2>
<p>Similar to Markus': a tool for resolving a DID to a DID Document</p>
<ul>
<li>We want different implementations in different languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Has a simple "resolve" function</p>
<p>You register methods with resolver, and then you can resolve them</p>
<h2 id="evernyms-vcx-verifiable-credentials-exchange-drummond">Evernym's VCX: Verifiable Credentials Exchange (Drummond)</h2>
<p>Show: Issuing a Verifiable Credential &amp; Using It</p>
<ol>
<li>Demo makes a connection between person &amp; company</li>
<li>Company offers a verifiable credential to person</li>
<li>Person gets verifiable credential offer on phone</li>
<li>Person chooses to accept it</li>
<li>Company then turns offer into credential</li>
<li>Person can then use selective disclosure of attributes on credential</li>
</ol>
<p>(This completes the issuance of the claim.)</p>
<p>Now person can use it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Second company makes a connection to person</li>
<li>Second company requests proof of credential from person</li>
<li>Person now receives request of proof</li>
<li>Person sends back proof fulled in with information</li>
<li>Second company gets proof from person </li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of this credentials exchange will be automated</p>
<h2 id="veres-one-manu">Veres One (Manu)</h2>
<p>A globally interoperable blockchain for identity, fit-for-purpose</p>
<ul>
<li>non-speculative, sustainable, low-cost</li>
<li>fast: 209 DID ops/sec, ~$1 for DID creation, 15-30 second consensus time</li>
<li>global</li>
<li>pure, capability-based system</li>
</ul>
<p>What can you do with a DID leger, using the DID client?</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a DID</li>
<li>Register it on a ledger</li>
<li>Retrieve it from ledger</li>
<li>Add or Rotate Keys</li>
</ul>
<p>Accelerators are used to fast-create DIDs instead of taking 6-9
proof-of-work hours to create DID.</p>
<h2 id="btcr-chris-kim">BTCR (Chris &amp; Kim)</h2>
<p>A Bitcoin DID </p>
<p>A descriptor encrypts Bitcoin height and index</p>
<p>As long as it's a standard P2PKH and there's still coins, it can be
used as a BTCR DID</p>
<p>You revoke it just by spending the coins!</p>
<p>Use the OP_RETURN to give additional information, like additional
keys, and point to the new tip</p>
<h3 id="btcr-tx-conversion-playground">BTCR TX Conversion Playground</h3>
<p>Can convert a BTCR txref to a txid or a blockheight and position
Or convert back from txid</p>
<p>Can take DID document from transaction, merge in OP_RETURN information
(really: information pointed to by OP_RETURN), and create a composite
DID documentation.</p>
<p>A SatoshiAuditTrail gives additional information like fees and amount
of money on the tip that sorts of creates a reputation(!) for the DID</p>
