*General Thoughts*

Water the plants that you want to grow.
(Instead of killing the ones that you don't like.)

Self-sovereign identity could catch on.
That's why Federated Identity was red-dotted yesterday.

*Building Trust*

_Who's Our Target Audience?_

Lots of people have good ideas, but we need something that's easy to use for the wider world.
We need to invent for them, not for ourselves.
Suggests top-down usability designs, not bottom-up technical designs
Technology and Application are different things.

We need one model with standardized words that are common place. This is one.

_One Model_

1. Entity with IDENTITY
- With IDENTIFIERS like names, IP addresses

2. AUTHENTICATION suggests whether identifier is being used in an authorized way

3. Objective ASSESSMENT can reveal attributes for identifier

Web of Recognition might be more accurate than subjective Trust

4. SYNTHESIS produces REPUTATION

We often start from a position of mistrust to create trust.

5. From SUPICION, we have TRUST

_I Am I_

The base issue is that I am I, but we have to bootstrap that to the online world.

How do you prove that? By having a secret (such as a private key), and a token that represents that secret.

One meaning for Web of Trust: having the ability to control our corner of the internet world.
It's a Question of Power.

That's the problem with X.509: everyone but you has control over your identity
We need to give people _control_ over their identity

_But, things are also being created, becoming 'I's_

We might need different systems for creating identity
Based on different ways that things created
A child might require auth from parents
A computer might be self-identified by producer

_But we need to be able to separate identities too_

A single strong identity is the antithesis of privacy
So that core binding has to be int he hands of the individuals

Universal global identifiers also have a lot of problems aside from privacy. 
Relations encoded into an identity system can create better identity.

_More About Web of Trust_

Web of Trust originated from PGP, where a web of friends can verify the authenticity of a key

Blockchain is different from this, because it has a different sort of Blockchain identifier.

But you could add a Web of Trust onto this.
