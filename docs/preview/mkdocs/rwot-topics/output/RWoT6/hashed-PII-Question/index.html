    <p>I decided to open a thread <a href="https://twitter.com/IdentityWoman/status/959047070790250496">On Twitter</a> for ID &amp; security professionals to share why (/if) putting hashed PII on any immutable ledger(blockchain) is a bad Idea. Not everyone agreed that it was bad if certain thingss were done right. There were 15 direct responses and then a whole lot of subthreads. I have pulled out all the subthreads. All tweets are linked to. Yes...all of them. Let me know if i missed a thread and I will pull it in.</p>
<p>I was told my blog post was not good enough. So I took the HTML turned it into Markdown. I believe it is harder to read. <a href="https://identitywoman.net/putting-hashed-pii-immutable-ledgerblockchain-bad-idea/">Here is the link to the original blog post</a> </p>

Long term, quantum decryption/future tech, any hash is reversible. As always, anonymity is a function of economics, not technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thread A)</strong> 
<a href="https://twitter.com/bkaptijn/status/959191195099521030">Joe Andrieu</a>: Hashes should be treated as the strongest locks we have, TODAY. For precious data, protect it through multiple means. Hash, shard, encrypt data, w/ nonces, salts, &amp; multiple indirection. There is no bullet proof solution. For a public record, SOMETHING has to be public. </p>
<p><strong>Thread B)</strong>
<span style="color: #333399;"><a href="https://twitter.com/bobblakley/status/959160841743556608">Bob Blakley</a>: You don't need to reverse a hash. Attributes are not like passwords; they're not like secrets and we often know in advance what the range of values is. "State of Residence", for example, has fewer than 60 values in the US, so the dictionary is tiny.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959161676149932032">Joe Andrieu</a>: But we're talking about the reversibility of hashes, not other correlation. You can ALWAYS modify your data to have a place for a salt, e.g., "State of Residence" can be concatenated with an arbitrarily long nonce before or after the data in question. No more dictionary attack.</span> 
<span style="color: #333399;">Bas Kaptijn: Though be carefull about the hash function used: <a href="https://t.co/ANVCZmbO5n" title="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="js-display-url">en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_ex</span><span class="invisible">tension_attack</span><span class="tco-ellipsis"><span class="invisible"> </span>…</span></a></span></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959171389633810433">Ben Laurie</a>: More nonsense. Quantum is not a magic wand. It doesn't work any better than classical against hashes. Also, hashes are demonstrably not generally reversible for arbitrary inputs (because there are an infinite number of inputs for each output, on average). </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959174217466966016">Joe Andrieu</a>: I thought the "/future tech" made it clear I was claiming any arbitrary future tech, including magic wands. Pretending today's tech is the only attack vector would be the cryptographic version of the Y2K mistake of two digit years.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rflxvty/status/959059565177376770">Branden@Reflexivity</a>: There may be GDPR issues in Europe: "The Article 29 Working Party has been unequivocal that hashing constitutes a technique of pseudonymisation, not anonymisation as it is still possible to link the dataset with the data subject."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thread A)</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/rflxvty/status/959060733525770241">Brendan@Reflexivity</a>: This relates to right to be forgotten, where you can ask a business to destroy all data that belongs you. If on immutable public blockchain, even in hashed form, if someone can theoretically recover the unhashed data which is associated with your ID then it's not GDPR compliant. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959061782043267072">Tim Bouma</a>: But I might not want to trust a business with my PII in the first place. <a href="https://twitter.com/rflxvty/status/959063873876668416">Brendan@Reflexivity</a>: Yep, that's the big crypto plan. Zero knowledge identity.</p>
<p><strong>Thread B)</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/Engbrg/status/959357210554982400">Stephan Engberd</a>: Notice that the legal term "pseudonymisation" in GDPR is a very, very weak term and has nothing to do with the use of the security use of the term in e.g. Identity (e.g. eIDAS 5.2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/959130024233222144">Christopher Allen</a>: Hashed data with suitable nonces, as well as various hash trees should not be considered pseudo-anonymous, as the same values hashed at another time result in different hashes and thus are not correlateable. But I agee bare hashes are often a bad idea — a lesson from FOAF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/martijnbolt/status/960139215454556160">Martin Bolt</a>: This is exactly why blockchain based attestation can be implemented within GDPR regulatory requirements while preserving sovereignty for users, without the need of trusted third parties whatsoever that (can) become the more sovereign. Many people I meet (deliberately) ignore this </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/960155641112399873">Tim Bouma</a>: Yup. This is the essence of the capability we are all looking for. No more, no less. Everything then, can be built up from this essence. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/martijnbolt/status/960231228862599169">Martin Bolt</a>: The thing is that this was already found a few years ago and I've personally shown that to the relevant people within my government. It seems they decided to keep looking, in directions other than this known solution, but more in the suboptimal direction of political interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bobblakley/status/959155028291391493">Bob Blakely</a>: Nonces don't help here; you have to know the nonce to verify the hash, so it's got to be public. And if it's public, the dictionary attack on the underlying attribute is still easy to execute for values from small finite sets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959155475605438464">Joe Andrieu:</a> A nonce within the data can remove the the dictionary attack vector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959170395206242304">Ben Laurie</a>: That makes no sense. You only need to know the nonce to verify the hash if you also know the hashed value. If you don't know the hashed value, then you don't need to know the nonce, either. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/959171133772791808">David G.W. Birch</a>: I think Bobs point is that if you are storing the hash of, say, age then it doesn’t take long to hash 1..129 and compare them with the stored hash. So therefore the hash of the age is PII. Is my interpretation correct Bob? </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959171821135376385">Ben Laurie:</a> But that's not what you do, you hash 1000 bits of randomness + the age. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NishantK/status/959184062358347776">Nishant Kaushik</a>: May be a naive question, but what purpose is the (salted) and hashed value of the attribute serving here for the RP (where the RP does not know and is not getting the actual value)? </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959184440005050369">Joe Andrieu</a>: The RP does get the actual value, along with the nonce, aka the payload. The hash of that payload is on chain, and can be verified as current by inspecting the chain. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NishantK/status/959217802535161856">Nishant Kaushik</a>: So the RP (multiple RPs?) would receive the original value, associated random (not a nonce since it is reused) and salt over the wire. Doesn't that defeat the security purpose of those?</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959049367767437312">Tim Bouma</a>: Lots of confusion between putting encrypted versus hashed info on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain?src=hash"><s>#</s><strong>blockchain</strong></a>. The former is BAD; the latter is ok, if it is a Merkle Root, separated from the Merkle Proof, and of course PII.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bobblakley/status/959109878060068864">Bob Blakley</a>: Additionally there will be the usual issue with deciding who's authoritative for an attribute - whose signature do you trust for each attribute? So basically you'll have to reinvent PKI to implement this. And if you already have PKI....</p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959903793826672641">Tim Bouma</a>: I think that's what we're all trying to figure out. Mass adoption of internet was largely due to no one controlling it. Mass adoption of a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/verifiableclaims?src=hash"><s>#</s><strong>verifiableclaims</strong></a> platform will need the same.</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Thread 1)</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959904527800520706">Tim Bouma</a>: There are some new ingredients in the mix (novel combination of existing ingredients, actually), hashes as guids, POW, etc. Some right combination will be found.</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/amigus/status/959914410335711232">Adam C. Migus</a>: Meh. It's a new implementation of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PKI?src=hash"><s>#</s><strong>PKI</strong></a> with a different trust model and role(s) for authorities. The more powerful participants will inevitably control it. If a society or system ever becomes egalitarian, it won't be because of a technology, however new and alluring it might be. </div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 60px;"> <strong>Thread 2)</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/amigus/status/959913557990301696">Adam C. Migus</a>: ...and look what's happening to the internet today i.e. net neutrality. Also look at what's happening with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash"><s>#</s><strong>Bitcoin</strong></a>. If there is mass adoption it won't stay independent nor will it's participants be assured "sovereignty," it'll be die or co-opted eventually, I'm afraid. </div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 60px;"> <a href="https://twitter.com/C1aranMurray/status/959946031814365184">Ciaran</a>: Already kind of has been. Bitcoin Core had to seize control of the development process in order to win the blocksize war. The powers that be now have a leadership that can be captured.</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/amigus/status/959915437151711237">Adam C. Migus</a>: P.S. thanks for the most plain, non-evasive answer I've ever gotten to that question. If we can cut out the hype and talk about it without rose-colored glasses, we might get somewhere.</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959931706433302528">Tim Bouma</a>: We're trying to tweak the ’I’ in PKI so it can be fair for everyone generations to come.</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/amigus/status/959940106936291328">Adam C. Migus</a>: ...and IMHO, unless that's an integral part of the discussion and solution, I think this work (if successful) is just as likely to encourage dystopia as it is egalitarianism.</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/amigus/status/959937326477729792">Adam C. Migus</a>: But that's just it, Tim. Technology can <em>at best</em> facilitate fairness, not assure it and, of all the work being done on this, I see no acknowledgement let alone action in response to that reality. The most direct answer I've gotten amounted to "someone else's problem."</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959959248154308616">Tim Bouma</a>: The flipside is that technology can also facilitates unfairness and effect less than desirable outcomes. The point I am trying to make is that we need understand with clarity before we accept or reject anything.</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959959570327187456">Tim Bouma</a>: And "some else's problem" invariably lands in the lap of government to solve. Now might be the opportunity to be a step ahead.</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/amigus/status/959971973307748353">Adam C. Migus</a>: Agreed, however, a comprehensive threat assessment that addresses actors like authoritarian governments, human traffickers and vulnerable participants is conspicuously absent at this point given it's criticality to understanding the system and developing effective policy for it.</div></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959321324773556224">Joe Andrieu</a>: Bob, yes. That's the point. The purpose of the Rebooting Web of Trust workshops <a href="https://t.co/fwc9n2h91M" title="http://rwot6.eventbrite.com"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="js-display-url">rwot6.eventbrite.com</span><span class="tco-ellipsis"><span class="invisible"> </span></span></a> is to fix what didn't work with PGP WoT and provide an alternative to PKI without the dependency and security risks of centralized root CA.</p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/tristanhoy/status/959922544001277952">Tristan Hoy</a>: Web of Trust is even worse than PKI in an internet setting. It requires end users to signal their political and sexual preferences, meaning that either 1) privacy is nonexistant or 2) alternate points of view can't earn "trust".'</div></p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959923285097029634">Joe Andrieu</a>: Where did you get that? There is no dependency on signaling anything in the web of trust models I know of.</div></p>

Mass adoption of a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/verifiableclaims?src=hash"><s>#</s><strong>verifiableclaims</strong></a> platform will need the same.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959959248154308616">Tim Bouma</a>: The flipside is that technology can also facilitates unfairness and effect less than desirable outcomes. The point I am trying to make is that we need understand with clarity before we accept or reject anything.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959052003988201474">Tim Bouma</a>: The basic requirement to be fulfilled is proving something was stated at some point in time and that it has not changed since. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain?src=hash"><s>#</s><strong>blockchain</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IdentityMonk/status/959191439509897216">Jeff Lambardo</a>: But is hash so immutable to sustain as a very old cold proof? As soon as Hash have collision, proof die. What if we store instead proof that "A successfully stated PII ξ Feb 1rst 2018 17:22 EST". Now I know I can trust A to state PII ξ value again if not proved unsuccessful since</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959192121554194433">Ben Laurie</a>: "not useful for proof in a decade" is not the same as "a bad idea". Also, what is your proof technique that will live forever?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IdentityMonk/status/959195256787910656">Jeff Lombardo</a>: 1) Don't challenge the use case, challenge the mean 2) Yes no hash mechanism is eternal Therefore I don't see added value of storing the hash of the PII ξ value if assurance aims for "A stated PII ξ at one point in time". Immutability of statement is already provided by DLT</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IdentityMonk/status/959195782581690368">Jeff Lombardo</a>: But I join late. May be my bad understanding of the case presented with the question</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lsaiz/status/959207586724745217">Jeff Lombardo</a>: Maybe you try to use hash value of ξ to prove [B] value of ξ did not change But then, there's more value to ask A... Cause if no one asks A to state again successfully value of ξ, DLT is not updated, no trace that ξ value changed. And you will be fooled by the old value of ξ</p>
<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959209507011227648">Joe Andrieu</a>: The assumption is that the issuer <em>will</em> update the DLT. That's the value proposition of the blockchain. You can record a hash publicly as a timestamp of a statement, then you can later make public statements <em>about</em> that statement, such as revocation, withdrawal, etc.</div></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959207872595767296">Joe Andrieu</a>:Asking the source is a privacy violation. The DMV and/or State Dept. have no need to know when I use their credentials to prove i'm over 21 or 18 or whatever.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lsaiz/status/959209511088218112">Luis Saiz Gimeno</a>: Age is a very special attribute. As far as I know if you sometime in the past was &gt;18 you also are &gt;18 now. Nobody will need to revoque it, obtain an “age attestation” signed by DMV/State and use it at your convenience</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959209825941970945'">Joe Andrieu</a>: Ditto for the right to drive. DMV doesn't need to know where I rent my vehicles. Is it really that hard to imagine a situation where individuals don't want to be surveilled all the time?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959183014407237632">Joe Andrieu</a>: Not if they hashed the data properly. Only recipients of both payloads can see the duplicity.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959185974587789312">Ben Laurie</a>: I am confused - are you telling me its possible to badly design protocols that are intended to prove honest behaviour? Coz I already knew that.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959186338523181056">Joe Andrieu</a>: Lol. Of course that's true. But, no, I'm saying the information on the chain is not comparable, so the "public" can't discover the duplicity. One must be a recipient of both payloads to discern the conflict.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959186892532211712">Ben Laurie</a>: Right, and if you need that property, then you should design your protocol to assure it. Obviously "put hash of stuff on the magic blockchain" is not a protocol design that solves all problems. Possibly not any problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959187486604869632">Joe Andrieu</a>: Which property did we need? I'm speaking from the work going on in the W3C Credentials Community Group regarding DIDs.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959188252564557825">Ben Laurie</a>: In this case, the property was "issuer can't issue incompatible assertions". According to you.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/futureidentity/status/959350915856822272">Robin Wilton</a>: However, as you say, verifiable maps could form the basis for a solution - or at least transparency - leaving it to the relying party to decide which assertion or AS to believe. 2/2</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959352195417174016">Joe Andrieu</a>: Exactly right. The receiving party decides what to believe from whom and how to reconcile differences.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959208497178005504">Joe Andrieu</a>: In some schemes, but it doesn't need to be. The issuer can revoke in such a manner that revocation is public and checking status leaks no data to the issuer. Further, the revocation itself can be protected to only be useful to those who already have the payload. No PII leaked.</p>

Post salted hash of VC to chain as timestamp. Now issuer can post to the chain a revocation/adjustment/correction/withdrawal/etc. Anyone with the VC can check the chain to verify timestamp and amendments.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959212514256007171">Joe Andrieu</a>: You're confusing the centralization of the identity platform, which is "on chain" and hence distributed, with the innate centrality of individual authorities. Forcing everyone to interactively check the source is a privacy problem. Which apparently, you don't understand.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959218564984053765">Joe Andrieu</a>: More correctly, I give you a verifiable credential, with a DID as a subject, which I can prove I control (aka the VC is about me).

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959218871713460224">Joe Andrieu</a>: It's as efficient as you need it to be. You don't HAVE to check the DLT.

Verifier just checks most recent keys &amp; revocation accumulator from the chain.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lsaiz/status/959216703153557505">Luis Saiz Gimeno</a>: Can you use another public service to store the same information? Why blockchain? Which differential property of blockchain are you using? If only issuer can revoque (change state), what kind of consensus about state change is adding blockchain here? That’s my main point.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959855974726230017">Ben Laurie</a>: Don't understand this point: Trillian ledgers and maps are trivially mirrorable by anyone. What property is "a blockchain" giving you that you don't get from Trillian + mirrors?</p>

<p><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/IdentityMonk/status/959944035329871872">Jeff Lombardo</a>: Trust is the result of a risk analysis. Paranoiac? Don't trust a CA cert but only correlation of 15 hash value of this cert acquired through 15 independent methods. Then, if you finally trust it, you just lowered your vuln score, but you are still at risk of consuming the service</div></p>
<p><div><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959912863778463744">Ben Laurie</a>: I object to the word "trust" because mostly when people say "A trusts B" they mean "A is vulnerable to B".

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959359603170398209">Joe Andrieu</a>: I expect both of those terms are so ill-defined as to preclude much reasonable discussion, especially as social recovery has so many potential forms, it's agressive of you to dismiss it as a terrible idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959360089688813568">Ben Laurie</a>: I would call it realistic. But yes they are ill defined, which is why I asked where they were documented.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959361710749446144">Joe Andrieu</a>: Even a simple multi-sig can prevent the theft of a single key from updating a DID record. It isn't hard to imagine what you can do to "enhance" key management with scriptSig or Solidity. The hard part is understanding the consequences of those enhancements.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959359305052033024">Ben Laurie</a>: And what the hell do you mean "you can address these on chain"?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959360585086283778">Joe Andrieu</a>: By on-chain, I mean that there are schemes for addressing these issues that involve using the blockchain for rotation, escalation, and recovery. These schemes are young and immature, but the options are being explored, debated, and implemented. Solutions will emerge.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959365014502170625">Ben Laurie</a>: The mechanics are easy enough. That's not the problem. The problem is recovering from total key loss, or key compromise, which blockchain makes no difference to.</p>
<p>To be frank: I've been thinking about this problem for years, and I've concluded that you need authorities.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959365216478924800">Ben Laurie</a>: Of course, this knocks a giant hole in the core idea of "self-sovereign", but that's the way it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ktorn/status/959399460232052736">Filipe Farinha</a>: Key management issues can be fixed in a decentralised way. You will probably need trusted wearables for it to work, but it’s possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/959400989794152448">Tim Bouma:</a> Similar to having two car keys. And going to an authorized dealer if you lose one.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ktorn/status/959403920450703362">Filipe Farinha</a>: Not really, unless the backup key was originally co-signed by you and that is recorded on the public ledger. If a third-party can revoke your keys, or issue new ones, without your publicly verifiable consent you’re doing it wrong.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959366264652152833">Joe Andrieu</a>: I appreciate your time invested. So, why don't you think social recovery--in some form--is a viable alternative to authorities? Isn't my social network a better authority on who I am than some displaced "authority" sitting in a corporate data center a thousand miles away?</div></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenLaurie/status/959477428237238272">Ben Laurie</a>: Because your social network has no obligation to you and is easily fooled. If they screw up, what is your recourse? You need someone with a contractual relationship with you, and sufficient reserve to fix what they break when they screw up.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoeAndrieu/status/959481849230708736">Joe Andrieu</a>: I find my most meaningful relationships are not defined by contract. Rather, I use contracts to handle exceptions, especially with people I don't know. It sounds like you don't believe a resilient system can be built on top of individually untrustworthy actors.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/giyom/status/959059113857630208">Giyom</a>: Putting hashed PII directly is an obvious bad idea but I would ask: is it a bad idea to put a hash of a verifiable claim which aggregates in a single object: PII, an issuer identifier, timestamps, payload sigs, subject identifier (typically a new random one for each claim). </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bkaptijn/status/959185695939137538">Bas Kaptijn</a>: To verify that an attestation really relates to an off ledger claim you'll need to be able to corelate it. If a hash (in attestation) is taken from a hard enough to guess mostly random one time use (per relationship) claim it can be made more "quantum safe" than the dlt used is.?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Engbrg/status/959354428255072256">Stephan Engberg</a>: You ask why pushing information about people online isn't a bad idea? Lots of reason why it is a bad idea: Abuse, lock-in, control (especially to to the online account model), legal. None to the opposite. Data should be locked to transactions, not to people. No reuse of Id! </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Engbrg/status/959356463536893952">Stephan Engberg</a>: Because hashing are ALWAYS susceptible to dictionary attacks and thus a security illusion as they leak data. Besides we talk deterministic cryptography which means it will be broken some day - e.g. hash collisions in which case they can be used to prove anything </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Engbrg/status/960103882511847425">Stephan Engberg</a>: Let's be very clear here - identity has to be resolved OUTSIDE an online blockchain as it will otherwise turn into a tool for centralized control </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Engbrg/status/959358821159374848">Stephan Engberg</a>: An example of what you NEVER EVER do is creating a genocide database storing non-revocable biometrics. A hash of biometrics even including other PII data is non-revocable biometrics A genocide database is any database that makes it possible to identify you from biometrics. <img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVBTSKnX0AEdKMD.jpg" />  </p>
