<h3 id="the-advent-of-self-sovereign-identity-with-blockchain">The advent of Self-Sovereign Identity with Blockchain</h3>
<p><strong>Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed are preparing a book about
decentralized digital identity in which many people from the global
identity and blockchain communities are participating. It is expected
that this book will become a reference piece about decentralized digital
identity and the self-sovereign identity ecosystem around the world. It
will be published in the autumn of 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Structure of the book</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the book is to be as evergreen as possible in
highlighting the importance of self-sovereign identity for the world,
sharing use cases in plenty of different industries, exploring the
concept of decentralization, explaining the basic architecture and
technology principles for SSI and the legal frameworks that will support
(and be enabled by) SSI. One-third of any revenue generated by the book
will be donated to RWOT, one third to IIW and one third to
SSIMeetup.org. The authors will not receive any monetary compensation
for the book.</p>
<p><span id="_gjdgxs" class="anchor"></span></p>
<p><strong>Anthology Format</strong></p>
<p>The book is designed to be an anthology composed of chapters contributed
by many different authors in the space. The first three chapters, by
Alex, Drummond, and Christopher Allen, will set the stage and provide
the big picture of SSI. Then there will be major sections as shown in
the TOC below.</p>
