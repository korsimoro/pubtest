    <h1 id="intro-plenary">Intro Plenary</h1>
<h2 id="what-were-doing">What We're Doing</h2>
<p>This is about publishing papers.</p>
<p>We are changing the world by publishing papers!</p>
<p>We're hoping for 5-8 papers.</p>
<h2 id="our-history">Our History</h2>
<p>We have largely lost a classic way of looking at identity, while the dangers have gotten worse, in the form of government spying, of stateless people.</p>
<p>We don't want to solve these problems in the centralized ways of the past. So we're looking at blockchain and other new technologies.</p>
<p>In the years since we've started, we've successfully moved some of our work to the W3C.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>We have a process.</p>
<p>But don't let it get in the way of our goal.</p>
<p><em>Papers.</em></p>
<p>We don't want great people twiddling their thumbs, as happens at many conferences.</p>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<p>But we have some hard and fast rules:</p>
<p>Papers need to be done by at least <em>two</em> different people, preferably from two different companies.</p>
<p>We have to get a first draft by end of week, with abstract and defined lead.</p>
<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>Simple: Don't be jerks.</p>
<p>Try to listen, not just speak.</p>
<p>Focus on <em>collaborating</em>.</p>
<p>The point is to let us have a productive and enjoyable three days, where no one feels <em>shut down</em>.</p>
