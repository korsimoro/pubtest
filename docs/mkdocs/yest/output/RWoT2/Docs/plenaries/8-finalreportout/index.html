    <p><strong>What is ID?</strong> [Lead Editor: Marta]</p>
<p>Many types.</p>
<p>Boil down to a small set of IDs.
(Legal ID, licenses, physical + social ID, etc.)</p>
<p>Created a table for defining identities</p>
<p><strong><em>Only the digital ID really matches how we want ID to work.</em></strong></p>
<p>Does that mean self-sovereign ID can only exist in virtual space?</p>
<p>A self-sovereign identity is more under person's control
Than their meatspace self!</p>
<p><strong>Identity Container &amp; Relations in DID</strong> [Lead Editor: Adrian]</p>
<p>How to link ID to identity container</p>
<p>Use case: Doctor writes prescriptions
Leaves behind a compliance element</p>
<p>Two DIDs: doctor, patient</p>
<p>Use Experience
1.) Invitation that creates container
2.) Provision identity container</p>
<p>Recurring:
3.) Transaction: prescription written, filled
4.) Persistent ledger entries</p>
<p>By introducing container
Can reduce some of the trust in centralized ledger</p>
<p><strong>Identity Graphs</strong> [Lead Editor: Markus]</p>
<p>Try to model parts of identity in a unified way
Start with a personal graph
Then create a relationship graph</p>
<p>Can use an "overlay graph" to show relations that
Don't exist on virtual sites</p>
<p>Can create graphs about others</p>
<p>Can create views of graphs</p>
<p>Result: <em>verifiable claims</em></p>
<p><strong>Cheap Verification</strong> [Lead Editor: Greg S.]</p>
<p>False idea that digital security is expensive
This idea has lead to CAs being able to gouge money</p>
<p>There is literally no need for authorities to secure internet connections
<em>Security authorities create insecurity!</em></p>
<p>Doesn't like idea of people serving DIDs either
Says they're just new DIDs</p>
<p><strong>Self-Sovereign Identity Architecture 2.0</strong> [Lead Editor: Dave C., but just going back to Manu, Justin Has Updates]</p>
<p>Continue to expand on Manu's paper. </p>
<p>Goal is to reduce to most salient boxes for model.
- So removed Registry
- It's now part of Oracle
- But Oracle does more, has Generators, Filestore</p>
<p>Dynamic Roles: One person can flip between roles</p>
<p><strong>Identity as Correlation</strong> [Lead Editor: Adrian]</p>
<p>[will meet in two weeks]</p>
<p><strong>DID</strong> [Lead Editor: Drummond]</p>
<p>Goals
1. The structure of an identifier (DID) creates a independent, discoverable, unique key for a value
2. The associative value must do four things:
- Prove ownership of value cryptographically: "Genesis Claim"
- Provie + update DIDs
- Point to other claims
- Point to other DIDs</p>
<p>Almost like a personal blockchain!
- Taking avantage of other consensuses + proofs of work</p>
<p>The debate: how much do we put in "head" object, 
As opposed to DID log as a whole
(It's an open architectural question)</p>
<p>[will do paper + specs]</p>
<p><strong>Uses Cases for Nairobi</strong> [Lead Editor: Wayne Hennesy]</p>
<p>Problems in Nairobi</p>
<p>[2 page paper done]</p>
<p>Other Stuff That Will Be Papers
<strong>HD Keys</strong> [Lead Editor: Kiara]
<strong>DID Use Cases</strong> [Lead Editor: Joe, Jonathan]
Revise <strong>Smart Signatures</strong> [Lead Editor: Chris, Ryan]</p>
