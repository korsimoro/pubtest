*DID System*

The problem it's solving is persistence: want it across multiple block chains, long-term

Decentralized identifier
ID allocation (three numbers)
Can be used for decades (or centuries)

Resilient
Interoperable

*Identity as Correlation*

A clearer, easier way to discuss identity
We can tell stories to help people understand what this means

This is about process of _identification_ creating identity

*Prectecting Digital Identity* 

User test case.

Self-employed street trader
Very poor, African 
- May have national ID
- But doesn't correlate to access to service
- Because those services don't exist

How do you prevent digital identity from being abused?
- Individual must be steward and protector
- Because cyber/physical identity are indivisible

This offers foundational, fundamental, transformational effects

*Chainpoint / Proof-of-X*

Want standards for verifiable records of proof of publication, proof of process. 

Need ways to link together identities as the attributes change over time.

The point of this is that it makes attestation easier.

*Identity Graphs*

Creating a systems of graphs to apply to distributed identities.
Model it with a unified, abstract graph.

Can also model relationships with people, with govt's.

The goal is to better access & manage stuff already out there, which is a nice
complement to self-sovereign identity.

*Identity Containers*

Spec identity chainers to link to blockchain IDs

Need to decide what to put on blockchain, and what not.

- Containers have ACL
- Containers have attribute stores, attestations
- Containers should work on distributed or cloud hardware
- All I/O should be hardened
- Other things than Blockchain might reference container
