Authors: Bohdan Andriyiv (bohdan.andriyiv@validbook.org)

Keywords: short_topic_paper_to_open_discussion, critique of The United Humans project 

This paper is an attempt to elicit critique, and start discussion to explore weak points of the [United Humans idea, project](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/united-humans.md)[1] and to encourage people to join its [boostraping effort](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rk32GV8BoEPQPgZ16AUNSj6zI04Kgxyo/view) [2]. 

* Existential
    * Do we need organization of the United Humans? Will it duplicate the the United Nations?
    * Are the United Humans' services going to be net positive for humanity? There might be unforeseen negative consequences caused by emergence of Kudos and the United Humans. Is risk of doing it, worth it?
    * Can we not do the United Humans or will it emerge anyway, given the existence of Kudos revenue model?

* Governance
    * How it will be governed? Will it be representative of all people on the Earth?
    * What power the organization of the United Humans will have? Will it have too much power? Will the United Humans become corrupt and/or ineffective eventually (see issues with UN, FIFA etc)?

* Technichal / SURLHI Arbitration (web of trust analysis). 
    * Can SURLHI arbitration (analysis of SURLHI's web of trust) be successful?
    * Will SURLHI (Statements of Unique Representation of Living Human Individual) arbitration be reliable? Will SURLHI claims be acknowledged as valid/honest correctly? 
    * How many successful Sybil identities (identities with fake SURLHI acknowledged as valid) will be out there?
    * Do we need human arbiters? Will there be enough arbiters? 

* Funding
    * How The UH organization is going to be funded in the long term? Is revenue model based on Kudos issuance and lottery sustainable?
    * What will be the price of Kudos at different stages of the UH development? Is it going to be high enough to incentivise the UH jump-start and continuous development?

* Products
    * Are The UH services going to be any better than services already provided by the market (Facebook, Google)? Why market cannot provide these services?
    * Government (not-for-profit) provided products tend to be subpar comparing to the market provided products, why The UH services be any better?
