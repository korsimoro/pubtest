# Initial Plenary: Introducing RWOT

This started two years ago with discussions with Jon Callas about PGP.

We now how the technical capabilities, but need to think about new things like censorship-resistance and decentralization.

We've moved stuff forward, such as ID2020 and DIDs. Self-sovereign ID has been getting more attention.

Leadership team is Christopher Allen, Drummond Reed, Manu Sporney, Kim Hamilton Duffy, and Joe Andrieu.

## What is Our Goal?

This is a design workshop.

Our goal is to get wonderful people together with lots of skills and _to ship_. By the end of Thursday, we want to have five or so specifications, white papers, or prototypes to at least the first draft level.
