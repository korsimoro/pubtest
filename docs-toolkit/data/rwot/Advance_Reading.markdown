This can eliminate the XDI discovery step as well the need for a-priori relationships or round trips between the XDI peers, and therefore enables immediately secure XDI connections (this is also known as a NIKE technique). The first generation of cryptographic XDI numbers is based on Ed25519 32 bit public keys and uses the cid-1 XDI scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Often discussions about digital identity suffers from a lack of precise arguments where the people discussing have different internal definitions of what identity means in the context. Thus there is a lot of conflation of identity vs reputation vs biometric IDs etc. I invite everyone to critizise the terminology used here and suggest better terms where appropriate, or to point out errors or other areas that should be covered. I will try to be general and to not introduce language specific to any particular implementation or technology stack. In the examples I will cover specific implementation stacks such as PGP, Ethereum, Blockstack or a CA-based centralized approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Unlike past client-server platforms, Web users interact with servers that link to other servers. When creating a new platform for multi-party interactions on blockchain technology, we should apply the lessons learned about how multi-party security is different from client-server security. The key insight is that it is crucial to be precise about where an exercised permission comes from.

We'll use the example of OpenPGP, the most common web-of-trust technology in use by far, and Bitcoin, the most succesful blockchain technology. Both technologies rely on chains of provable statements. In Bitcoin if Alice pays Bob who pays Charlie who pays David we have a transaction chain:     tx-Alice <- tx-Bob <- tx-Charlie <- tx-David This is not unlike a trust chain of signed keys that might give David some assurance that a message from Alice really is from Alice, where David has signed Charlie's key who has signed Bob's who has signed Alice's.

Today’s dominant code signing and verification technologies rely on centralized certificate authorities and/or centralized hardware or operating system vendors. These solutions are typically oriented toward end-user installation of applications and do not address the needs of software developers who increasingly rely on externally developed components in both source and binary form. Open Source Software has moved us in the direction of the Bazaar [catb] and created an incredibly powerful and diverse supply chain, but has brought with it new risks. Language-specific software component repositories such as Maven, NPM, RubyGems, and CocoaPods are not as secure as they should be and yet most developers have no alternative but to assume their component downloads have not been tampered with. In the rare circumstances where developers are validating their downloaded components they’re using homegrown validation tools and often manually verifying hashes. Typically file hashes are stored on the same server as the hashed file to be validated. If the download is compromised, the hash will be too. Developers need a way of sending and receiving decentralized, secure, and human meaningful information that can be used to secure software components and applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Cryptographic keys establish an identity, digital signatures prove an identity agreed to the contract and a cryptographic hash of the contract acts as a tamper-proof record of the contract. Products are paid for using multi-signature escrow contracts with arbiters digitally signing transfer of funds to the seller or back to the buyer in case of disagreement over the quality or specifications of the goods delivered. The upside of bypassing centralized services such as eBay or Uber is that no third party can charge excessive fees, impose restrictive policies, prohibit Bitcoin payments or present a single point of failure in the storing of users’ personal data. However, the downside is that no organization is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the system and guard against Sybil attacks and fake ratings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This zeitgeist can broadly be called decentralized collaboration. In the United States, organizations are atomizing into flexible services and autonomous, purpose-driven small businesses. Deloitte reports the ecosystems of value creation that are emerging create both competitive and collaborative advantage. Several forces are driving this change. Freelance work represents a significant driver. Today, freelancers and gig workers make up 34% of the US work force. In keeping with these trends, Intuit and MBO Partners optimistically predict that by 2020 freelancers will represent 43-50% of the work force. Although these numbers may be inflated, there is strong evidence that autonomous work forces are expanding. Organizational functions are unbundling to empower this atomized economy of freelancers and worker hives. Small ventures are freed to focus on core value by leveraging services like Zen Payroll, Zen99, and Zenefits for accounting; Clerky for legal support; gig work through Lyft, Uber, and Thumbtack; WeWork and Impact Hub for co-working.

I did what I do with all technical discussions I participate actively in - I worked hard to figure out on a deep level what was actually meant by this phrase - what is it? how do trust framworks function? And from there I returned to my center of attention: What are the implications for end-users? The phrase 'Trust Frameworks' seems particularly pervasive and not yet defined well. After struggling for several months it became clear to me… that it is a technology/policy(legal) sandwich that is used to allow large complex networks/multi-party systems to function. In the identity world this was called a Federation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

All this issues are consequences of the trustless nature of existing blockchain implementations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and (partially) Ripple that work under the assumption that there should not be a central party that controls the system. This implies the presence of a single blockchain/ledger and global consensus over it. While we fully agree on the need for decentralized financial infrastructure, we believe that techniques that are used in Bitcoin etc are not directly applicable to it. Ideas and mechanisms that are described in this paper are rather simple - 1) each entity has its own ledger(s) that contains its transactions and balances 2) there is no global shared ledger at all 3) there is no global consensus 4) there are no designated validators - financial institutions (gateways and other trusted parties) are validators. To simplify things you can imagine the existing state of the things when each business and individual has its own financial ledger and they are updated individually and then apply the blockchain data structure, cryptographic techniques and a standard set of communication protocols to it. Basically we are describing the financial internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Ceptr is a rebuild of much of the computing stack optimized for decentralized sense-making, computation and composability. This means semantics baked into the lowest levels of memory storage, self-describing protocols which let anything talk with anything else, blockchain-like abilities for decentralized data storage and computation. Our approach addresses many issues people are tackling in a variety of projects (web of trust, blockchain, semantic web, decentralized applications, federated identity, ease of interoperability, rapid code evolution with massive reuse, mesh networks, etc.) through a unified approach. We know providing such a different approach creates barriers to adoption and understanding, but we also know that applications in Ceptr will be able to be developed faster, easier and should significantly outperform projects which have been cobbled together from more traditional tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

One of the most persistent in modern market systems is the Kenysian beauty contest. In short, when asked to pick the most beautiful person, the most profitable and efficient strategy is to predict what other people will predict, not attempt to converge on what is actually the most beautiful. Modern market systems inevitably follow this trajectory. A distributed trust ledger may follow a different logic than a market and create other tracks complementary to it. Numerous "social web" systems in which karma or other points are accumulated show divergent logics. Example services are Amazon reviews, Wikipedia articles, Facebook likes, Facebook friends, Twitter followers, Instagram likes, and aggregation services like Klout. In many cases, there is a very significant divergence between people who have some sort of accumulated social capital via their contributions and financial capital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The ideas discussed in the post compelted me to the point of searching around for the writers contact info. But instead of the typical name and email address I expected, all I found was a pseudonym and PGP fingerprint. I could figure this out I thought. That morning at the local breakfast spot I was talking to my friends about my encryption plans for the day. When the man sitting next to me at the restaurant overheard. A fellow PGP user, on his way to a python convention. He gave me his business card and said that if I ever figured out PGP I should try to send him an encrypted message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

As used in PGP, in X.509 certificates used by TLS, and in other protocols, the number of private keys are few and they they do not expire for many years. Instead, to maximize privacy Bitcoin rapidly cycles through keys, discarding old keys from past transactions as soon as the public key is revealed and the coins are spent. Since each address is hashed from a public key, this means that a Bitcoin user needs to deal with a large lot of keypairs. The traditional answer for this problem has been wallets — which collect and manage keys so that users don’t have to. The earliest Bitcoin wallets still faced challenges. That’s because the Bitcoin Core and early clients generated each key randomly. Unfortunately, this methodology requires careful (and constant) backups to ensure continued access to all funds. It also opens some privacy loopholes; because new key generation wasn’t trivial, single keys were often reused when they shouldn't have been. Transactions could be correlated if they used the same address (and thus keypair) for change, requiring even more keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

CONIKS builds on transparency log proposals for web server certificates but solves several new challenges specific to key verification for end users. CONIKS obviates the need for global third-party monitors and enables users to efficiently monitor their own key bindings for consistency, downloading less than 20 kB per day to do so even for a provider with billions of users. CONIKS users and providers can collectively audit providers for non-equivocation, and this requires downloading a constant 2.5 kB per provider per day. Additionally, CONIKS preserves the level of privacy offered by today’s major communication services, hiding the list of usernames present and even allowing providers to conceal the total number of users in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Bitcoin allows anyone to send value without a trusted depository or custodian. However, due to limitations to block confirmation, transactions require up to one hour. Additionally, individual micropayments below several cents are not worthwhile on the Bitcoin blockchain as the on-blockchain transaction fees are several cents. Lightning Network conducts net settlement of funds between two participants which allows one to conduct an unlimited amount of transactions off-blockchain, but eventually settling the transactions on-chain.  The Lightning Network does not require cooperation from the counterparty to exit the channel. Both parties have the option to unilaterally close the channel, ending their relationship. Since all parties have multiple multisignature channels with many diferent users on this network, one can send a payment to any other party across this network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Traditionally, the answer has been to use a centralized naming system. Trusted authorities act as the root of a global name space that connects names with public keys to certify who people are. Unfortunately, this classic setup has problems. The earliest complaints focused on the 1988 x.509 standard and said that it was overly complex and overly formal. However, as the internet grew, people soon realized that there was a bigger problem: in a global name space, names quickly failed as a means of unique identity. If someone is verified by a certificate authority (CA) as Christopher Allen, who are they, really? Is it the psychic medium? The UCSF assistant professor? The security technologist? A traditional certificate can’t tell you. CA-based systems also require validation and revocation which recent SSL attacks like HeartBleed have proven have not adequately deployed or scaled to meet security requirements. Other aspects in the centrality of architecture in CA-based systems have also made them vulnerable to new forms of attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

User adoption is very low, even in relation to the userbase already using OpenPGP-based software for communication. A PKI can and must be created which does not require expert-level knowledge of public-key encryption to use properly. A PKI's job is to store and retrieve public keys and their respective global identity bindings: identifiers of personal location or accounts controlled by the key's owner and associated with that key. The key is queried via a bound identity attribute (e.g. email address), and the PKI will also return all certificates asserting the validity of these identity bindings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

A blockchain with a fully featured virtual machine such as Ethereum (with its Ethereum VM or EVM) or the recent Bitcoin sidechain project Rootstock (also EVM-based) provides a rich scripting language with which to build tools that can be used in a PKI. A blockchain with such a virtual machine allows the user to send transactions creating blockchain-native programs, sometimes called "smart contracts" or simply "contracts". These programs have an associated address and expose API functions which can be called by sending a transaction to the address with a data message containing the signature of the function along with its parameters. The programs are run by miners and they have associated storage and/or funds (Ether in the case of the Ethereum blockchain) which is updated upon contract execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

I believe that as we evolve social software to better serve our needs and the needs of the groups that we are involved in, we need to figure out how to apply an understanding of how human groups behave and work. One useful concept I use I call "Progressive Trust". The basic idea is to model how trust works in the real world, between real people, rather then solely relying on mathematical or cryptographic trust. This is how I typically explain progressive trust when I meet someone in-person at a conference: You are now spending your most precious resource, your most unrenewable commodity -- time, in order to listen and understand what I have to say. Why do you do so? Because by the act of us being here in this common space, at this conference, you have found a very simple credential from me -- that I'm willing to spend time here in a place that you are interested in as well. In turn, I'm willing to spend more time chatting with you for the same reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Their hometown in Syrian was under bombardment, being slowly overrun by ISIS forces. They had relatives to sponsor them in the West, with funds and a willingness to take them in, but they lacked the crucial documentation proving their refugee status. Desperate to settle and find normalcy, the boy’s father loaded his family into a boat to seek other options. The boat sank. And the boy, his mother and brother were dead, because his family lacked the documentation to prove who they were and what they had endured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

At the center of this shift is how we account for trust. In order to unlock the potential of P2P and decentralized transactions taking place between entities, a relational matrix must be constructed. That is, a web of trust to empower digital entities to seamlessly and at low cost/low friction- transact with each other in a regime that can secure the interests of all parties. In other words, the next great internet revolution will take place once we can simultaneously interact with existing systems and their legally binding constructions and a new fabric for Identity and digital assets powered by algorithmic governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Early implementations based on the prime-number based RSA algorithm were dominant in the ‘90s. In recent years discrete logarithm and elliptic curve approaches have become more popular because they allow for improved computational efficiency and smaller key size without diminishing security. In the discrete logarithm space, ElGamal-based signature schemes have been the most deployed — thanks in large part to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) releasing their patented DSA under a royalty-free license when implementing the FIPS 186 standard in '93. Even Bitcoin has adopted a variant of DSA: the elliptic-curve based ECDSA, which uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Capability Systems are an alternative model of operating system security design. Historically, Capability Systems lost out to Access Control Lists (ACL). However, these ideas are due to be reconsidered, because Capability Systems are viable in cryptographic decentralized systems, but ACLs are not. Security systems are about granting and denying access to resources. In the physical world, we can observe a variety of approaches to security that are analogous to both ACLs and Capability Systems. For example, a your car has registration papers, which are like an access control list. These are probably administered by an organization which is administered by your government. Centralized Authority all the way up. If you cannot prove that you own or otherwise have the right to be driving a given car you may be arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle. On the other hand, the car key is analogous to a capability. If you possess the keys to the car, you can start it and drive away. If you give the keys to another driver then they have the same capability to access the car that you do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Security of most online communication and web traffic depends on the security of these systems. Current PKI systems usually require trusting a central party like Verisign and DNS has many security issues e.g., DNS cache poisoning. Crypotocurrency blockchains are a potential alternative to traditional DNS and PKI systems that can provide better security and decentralization guarantees. The technology is relatively new and evolving rapidly, little production data or experience is available to guide design tradeoffs. In this paper, we summarize our experience with running a large-scale production deployment of a naming system on top of a cryptocurrency (Namecoin), and discuss how our experience informed the design of a new blockchain-based naming and PKI system called Blockstore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Identity fragmentation and selective disclosure has huge benefits for privacy. If a service only requires a singly piece of information on a user, like a liquor site that needs to know if a user is of age, the service can ask the user to present a statement of age that has been self-attested AND has been attested to by a party that the service trusts, whether that be a DMV, a corporation or an individual. This allows the person to prove he/she is of age without revealing his/her identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

However, it is not a simple role. This paper attempts to describe the role that identity plays in enabling multiple actors, each operating from their own perspective, to rely upon one another to improve their own situational awareness and take action. It then explores the expectations and pressures that identity enables actors to place upon one another, as well as the way that those expectations and pressures can change in response to shifts in the external environment. It details the relationship between privacy and transparency in the identity realm and the impact that this has on the regulation of the community as a complex adaptive system more generally. Finally, it concludes with a series of proposals for specific technical solutions to address some of the tension balancing requirements that are necessary to enable communities to self-regulate amidst changing circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

So What's This About A "Generic Thin Client Protocol?" Blockchains are difficult to run on most end-user devices. A thin client (or a light client) refers to software that downloads only a portion of the blockchain [1]. This gives clients some ability to verify for themselves the authenticity of information within it. The Internet needs a blockchain agnostic and technique agnostic thin client specification. Agnosticism is essential because: Any blockchain may become abandoned by the Internet community. The “ideal blockchain” is unknown and may not exist. Non-agnostic protocols promote potentially harmful centralization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Much has written about PGP and practical public key cryptography. Much of this is to our opinion only mostly accurate. It is our goal in this chapter to describe the PGP models, as well as their implementation, standardization, and use. We also will put this in its historic and political context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

PGP's web of trust uses a form of this, but it is fairly primitive and lacks widely accepted standards. Blockchain ID identity statements can be used for a form of web of trust. All parties involved in the statement, including the issuer and the subject of the statement can locally cache the statements and present them to others as needed. Statements can be revoked using updating one's zone file on Blockstore and appending a hash of the statement to a list of revoked statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Bryce Glass and I have studied hundreds of online reputation systems, including dozens that we helped develop. As we noted in the preface to Farmer and Glass (2010a, ix), “Today’s Web is the product of over a billion hands and minds. Around the clock and around the globe, a world full of people are pumping out contributions small and large: full-length features on Vimeo; video shorts on YouTube; comments on Blogger; discussions on Yahoo! Groups; and tagged-and-titled Del.icio.us bookmarks.” Given the myriad contexts in which reputation is being used, it may be surprising to the reader that there is not yet any consensus on this field’s fundamental terminology. We therefore define reputation as “information used to make a value judgment about an object or a person.” But we acknowledge the special role of the reputation(s) of a person and therefore suggest a special term for this: karma.

Additional challenges include: How can the parties to the data sharing agreement identify and authenticate each other such that they can safely interact for the period of time it is effective? How can such a data sharing agreement be portable, so the parties are not dependent on any particular app or service provider to enforce it? How can such a data sharing agreement be adaptable to different security and privacy policies, so it is not obsoleted as new technologies arrive?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This topic paper outlines that proposed architecture and its primary components and actors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Greg recently started a discussion about decentralization properties of Blockstack. We really appreciate that he took the time to start this discussion, because we believe that it's very important that decentralization properties are well understood and any concerns about centralization are properly addressed. In this document, I'm going to go over Greg's points and provide some additional information that is not in the Blockstack paper draft yet. Readers are encouraged to read Greg's full document for proper context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This implicitly forces us to only look in one particular place for one specific resource. The L at the end stands for Location, more specifically, one particular DNS name and the set of locations specified by its owner. Outside of the web, when we point to things, we use the name of the objects instead of the place where we can find it. Consider buying a book and knowing that its name is library1.com/book-12345 instead of having a name that you can try to find in several libraries - exactly like ISBN. If we can assign different names to distinct resources that everyone could agree upon (e.g. for example hash functions applied to its content) then, it doesn't matter where the content, since it could be on multiple locations. Having one singular location is a single point of failure, since that location could disappear, be censored and alterated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Identity in the physical world has typically been asserted via decentralized mechanisms, mainly paper; i.e., identity is managed individually with claims and attributes that are verified by third parties. Modern computing techniques have centralized this process with various registries and databases that have become repositories for unintentional exploitation. New decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, hash tables and semantic data graphs can enable the design and deployment of a decentralized identity architecture that can vastly improve security and privacy of individuals and entities in the digital world. This will lead to users on the internet becoming individuals with sovereign rights and ownership and control over their digital selves in similar ways that we have control over our physical selves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

These currencies, utilizing blockchain technology allow for anyone with an internet connection anywhere in the world to  send an arbitrary measure of value to anyone else with an internet connection anywhere in the world with a small fee, rapidly,  and unconditionally, without risk of chargeback.  Further, these transactions are unmediated by any third party; to permanently  stop them, you'd have to shut down the entire internet, an unlikely proposition.  At present most of these coins offer only  pseudonymous transfers, but coins using Coin-Join and Zero Knowledge Proof technology offer possibilities for more anonymity  and minimal traceability for transactions for those who desire it.   The Blockchain, by combining peer-to-peer network that  solves the byzantine  generals problem and the double-spending problem, secures a publicly readable, distributed ledger to  maintain the balances that each public/private key-pair has management rights over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

For identity systems separating the tasks of mapping human-relevant identity to cryptographic identity, and managing the cryptographic identity itself, has the potential to simplify both layers, and enable cryptographic identity innovation by removing the need to update all signature validators for every signing-side innovation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In rethinking the web of trust, this distributed public key infrastructure removed any dependence on central authorities and established a method of rooting identity in a blockchain distributed database. While this effort defined a way for everyone and everything to have a sovereign identity , 2 it did not propose a means for using the distributed identity for resource creation and consumption. Nor did it propose a means of claims exchange that meets basic security and privacy requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

DLT is: A ledger that generally runs in a hostile environment like the public internet It uses cryptography to try and solve identity and ownership problems in this public environment It uses cryptography to try and automate business processes & reduce latency to accelerate the value of money Assets are on and managed on the ledger. Off ledger interactions are considered legacy, slow, and inefficient. Most real use cases of this technology are theoretical discussions, unimplemented, without a single live use case with enough scalability, security, or appropriate regulatory framework in place. There is no privacy, all transactions are on this public ledger and all parties can see those transactions. DLT is the technology not the actual asset. The asset is the application utilizing the DLT (Stock trades, payments, swap trade, currencies, bonds & coupons, etc). Transactions are absolute, there is no reverting the transaction. Chargebacks/returns are a business process because the ledger cannot be reversed. You must initiate a transaction back to the originating party. Current DLT Identity & Data security mechanisms is 'relatively unused' cryptography built for financial services in 1990's. These mathematics has a certain lifetime because computers and distributed calculations are getting faster & more efficient.

With the ghosts of WWI still lurking, he spoke movingly about the wages of war and ongoing suffering of millions displaced by years of famine and war across Germany, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Middle East. Nansen stated that the future could not be “built on despair, distrust, hatred, and envy.” Rather, he declared, the first prerequisite for defeating the disease of conflict and war was “an understanding of the cause and nature of the disease itself.” “Such an understanding,” he cautioned, “is certainly not attainable in a day. But the first condition for its final establishment is the sincere will to understand.” 1 A polar explorer and scientist, Nansen was named the League of Nation’s first High Commissioner for Refugees in 1920. Over the next decade he helped hundreds of thousands to return home, while enabling others to become legal residents and find work in the countries where they found refuge. Nansen saw that a primary problem faced by refugees was a lack of internationally recognized identification papers. His solution was the first legal instrument for international protection of refugees, which become known as the “Nansen passport.” [2](http://stories.unhcr.org/nansen-passport- p34721.html)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Moving things dynamically change context, and when they do, there is the opportunity, or requirement, to perform a transaction. These transactions will become increasingly automated and will dramatically affect areas such as Trade Finance. Combining Physical Automation (IoT/IoMT) with Financial and Transactional Automation (Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains) will result in Economic Automation. For instance, autonomous shipping containers will negotiate their own transit, dynamically adjust their insurance, validate their modes of transportation (Is this the right ship?), and perform other operations without the need to involve humans in-the-loop. A key enabler to create this Economically Automated world will be the ability for all of the parties involved, who are not going to be humans, to be able to obtain and trust their respective identities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

We all do it. We use the vernacular shorthand for a term because we know people will understand it.  “Identity” is one of the 3000 core words in the English language. It’s powerful and resonant.  Essentially  all English speaking persons understand it.  Yet when we speak about identity as a property of a person or thing, it is easy to gloss over the  mechanics of what’s going on and obscure the very issue we are trying to discuss. As a result, different  people use the same term to mean radically different things and smart, well‐meaning collaborators get  lost in miscommunication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Here the meaning of identity is derived from the characteristics of the identity system, that is, what the identity system provides. Instead of defining identity a priori, this white paper describes an identity system and then defines identity within the context of that identity system. Many of the features of the identity system has been influenced and inspired other proposed systems such as Open Reputation. [1] [2] [3] This paper argues that an identity system that simultaneously provides a high degrees of sovereignty, security and privacy is best obtained via an open platform that employs distributed consensus protocols and modern cryptographic techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

In order for a technology or system to be replaced it only needs to provide a marginal improvement to the current or existing system. Such that the cost of implementation can be realized over a reasonable amount of time, or that the costs are irrelevant because evolving the system is an ethical necessity. In the case of the current standard of centralized identity systems both reasons for change, financial and ethical, are reasonably arguable. There are a vast number ways to improve the efficiency of the current system.

Regulations might allow for identity credentials to be attested by a trusted third­party such as a solicitor, priest or village chieftain. But these attestations are typically low­fidelity paperware affidavits, with wet signatures. They are easy to fake and have limited utility or credibility ­ particularly as the basis for proving identity in digital applications. This has led us to research potential methods to digitise and democratise peer attestations so that any individual can have their identity assertions validated and enriched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

As part of these agreements, introduces an ability to provide one-time modular Terms and Conditions that can be consistently applied horizontally across many products and services. Introduces technology that allows for anytime revocation of attributes and agreements resulting in only the loss of identified and supported atomic functionality within products and services, and not necessarily the wholesale loss of use of those products and services altogether. Introduces an approach for determining the lifecycle of LOA settings for an individual based on the current condition of all attribute declarations whether they are validated or not, and within the range of that providers certification for a particular framework. Introduces an approach for federated assurance by de-coupling enforcement points from decision points by adoption of a standard, open protocol. Postulates that there should be a fourth A added to the typical security list of AAA – and that is Assurance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Some questions/challenges around this: How should the user practically manage the keys of multiple identities (assuming for simplicity that one key controls one identity) HD wallets are a good method of managing a virtually unlimited number of keys. If HD wallets are used, should the user be responsible for storing and maintaining the seed? Is this too much of a burden for the user? If the user loses their HD wallet seed, can there be a reset feature that restores all their identities/personas? If so, how would this recovery work? A Shamir Secret Sharing scheme can be used to recover the seed from a threshold of recovery members holding pieces of the seed. This protects against loss, but not against compromise. Is there a good way that the seed can be replaced instead of reconstructed to also protect against compromise (similar to discussion about key recovery)?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In fact, last year when I first approached Dr. Pierre Louis Aublin, one of the authors of the RBFT paper on which the Plenum protocol is based, and I asked his thoughts about scaling a BFT protocol, he started to laugh. BFT protocols are hard to scale. In contrast to traditional enterprise distributed systems, adding more nodes does not improve the throughput. In fact, adding nodes, while increasing the integrity of the system, actually reduces its overall throughput. In this paper, we will briefly describe Plenum, the consensus protocol used for the Sovrin Distributed Identity Ledger. Then we’ll discuss a set of mechanisms that allow us to scale it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

A sovereign identity can never be taken away by another authority. This and other principles of sovereign identity are explained in another paper for the ID2020 Design Shop, A Self­Sovereign Identity Architecture by Christopher Allen, and also in the blog post Why Companies Need Self­Sovereign Identity from Phil Windley at Brigham Young University. The main enabler of sovereign identity is distributed ledger technology (“blockchain”). However, to implement the principles of sovereign identity, these principles must be followed right down to the most foundational architectural component: how identities are registered on a distributed ledger. This paper proposes the use of three globally unique namespaces: 1. DIDs(decentralized identifiers)—machine­generated globally unique identifiers that do not have cryptographic properties. 2. CIDs (cryptographic identifiers)—machine­generated globally unique identifiers with cryptographic properties. 3. Aliases—registered identifiers from other global namespaces that simplify discovery of DIDs and CIDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Internet Identity Workshop next week; then I’m speaking at the blockchain conference Consensus about identity; next I am part of the team putting together the first ID2020 Summit on Digital Identity at the United Nations; and finally I'm hosting the second #RebootingWebOfTrust design workshop on decentralized identity. At all of these events I want to share a vision for how we can enhance the ability of digital identity to enable trust while preserving individual privacy. This vision is what I call “Self-Sovereign Identity”. Why do we need this vision now? Governments and companies are sharing an unprecedented amount of information, cross-correlating everything from viewing habits to purchases, to where people are located during the day, to where they sleep at night, and with whom they associate. In addition, as the Third World enters the computer age, digital citizenship is providing Third World residents with greater access to human rights and to the global economy. When properly designed and implemented, self-sovereign identity can offer these benefits while also protecting individuals from the ever-increasing control of those in power, who may not have the best interests of the individual at heart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The decision to write on this topic solidified when I was traveling from my home in San Leandro California in a Sikh Ashram to the European Identity Conference in Munich. On that journey I encountered two different uses of the word “trust”. The first instance was a sticker on the back of a car I saw parked outside as I was leaving. The first instance “The Sexiest Thing is Trust” a quote from a Toni Amos song on a bumper sticker is referring to interpersonal human to human trust. The second instance on a advertisement in the Zurich airport "Trust. Five extremely demanding letters." is talking about trust in organizational systems and processes. It is an advertisement for PICTET “Founded in Geneva in 1805…one of the leading independent wealth and asset managers in Europe” One is about deeply human feelings and connection within human relationships the other is about an institutions ability to support individuals hoarding wealth for themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Although the fully decentralized packet-switching mechanisms of the Internet might be claimed as an example, the practical Internet relies at least on the Domain Name System, which very much does have a single point of control, at the top of its registration and operations hierarchies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Its underlying data model is a graph consisting of nodes and directed arcs. XDI is well-suited for digital identity that is distributed and heterogeneous. Through the use of mappings and connectors, XDI can be used to model even data that is not itself natively in XDI format (e.g. a Facebook profile, a government ID, or a record in a corporate database). Traditionally, XDI assumes a network topology that involves service providers and endpoints, e.g. a connection can be established between an individual and an organization through their respective endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This paper explores what self‐sovereign identity means independent of  technology: what people need from independent identity capabilities. I want to understand how such a  system enables both individuals whose identities are in play (subjects), as well as those who use those  “identities” to correlate interactions across contexts (observers). I start with grounding individual  sovereignty in the Enlightenment and identity in its core function of correlation, then propose core  characteristics of a self‐sovereign identity system. My eventual goal is to model the technology‐ independent requirements of a self‐sovereign solution suitable for realizing UN Sustainable  Development Goal 16.9: “Providing every last person on the planet with a legal identity by 2030.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Instead, there are many different futures, each of which carries its own weight and relies upon a different set of assumptions. The assumptions that shift which world we actually come to inhabit are many. They include the progression of various combinatorial technologies. They include political and institutional decisions. Perhaps most consequentially, they include human intention as individuals strive to achieve their own preferred futures. To this end, when considering the future of identity that may come of the projects we undertake in the present, it’s useful to think about how these projects will evolve across a number of potential future environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Attestations provide a way for an identity to make a claim that can then be verified at a later point in time. We will attempt to categorize attestations in terms of their relationship to blockchain systems and give some use cases for the different categories of attestations. We assume that there is a system of decentralized identifiers and a reliable mapping from an identifier to its corresponding signing key. This mapping would most likely be done using a blockchain, but one could potentially use a Certificate Authority for the mapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

When information is presented as Linked Data, other related information can be easily discovered and new information can be easily linked to it. Linked Data is extensible in a decentralized way, greatly reducing barriers to large scale integration. With the increase in usage of Linked Data for a variety of applications, there is a need to be able to verify the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data documents. The Linked Data Signatures specification added authentication and integrity protection to linked data documents through the use of public/private key cryptography without sacrificing Linked Data features such as extensibility and composability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

From the standpoint of cryptographic trust verification, each of these centralized authorities serves as its own root of trust. To make identity management work across these systems requires implementing federated identity management. The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), sometimes referred to as blockchain technology, provides the opportunity to implement fully decentralized identity management (DIDM). In DIDM, all participants with identities (called identity owners) share a common root of trust in the form of a globally distributed ledger (or a decentralized P2P network that provides similar capabilities). In a DIDM architecture, each identity owner can be identified on a ledger with a key-value pair. The index key is a decentralized identifier (DID) and the value is its associated DID description object (DDO). Together these form a DID record. Each DID record is cryptographically secured by private keys under the identity owner’s control. Following the dictums of Privacy by Design, each identity owner may have as many DID records as necessary to respect the identity owner’s desired separation of identities, personas, and contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This program is currently operated mostly as a manual system with paper forms. However, this pays out many millions (USD) funding each month and the government wishes to increase funding in future years as a national priority. Large sums of money, remote communities, poor oversight, and a lack of infrastructure have inevitably created a situation where it is difficult to know how effectively the current system is performing, identify service gaps and prevent fraud, which is currently rife. There is clearly a great opportunity to leverage technology in ways that can improve the efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of social development and benefit programs such as this. Consent is implementing a Proof of Concept to create decentralized digital registries of children, their caregivers, service providers and the service centers they attend, using Decentralized Digital Identity standards. This will provide the basis for tracking the delivery of early learning services and administering the government daily attendance subsidy over future years.

Accordingly, there is no area of the brain in which “self,” as a depth experience or as a  category or object of experience, is centralized or can be said to “reside.” Rather, relationships between nodes in the neural  network are activated differently on the basis of which “mode” of self is being operationalized: whether it is the explicit  recognition of one’s image in a mirror, the ascription of adjectives to oneself, or the prereflective stream-of-consciousness  self-experience characteristic of activity that does not depend on self-objectification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This paper explores the types of modular standards that may be useful in a predicted future blockchain ecosystem containing tens to hundreds of thousands of interoperable blockchains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

They get a fraction of a cent for an ad played on YouTube, and nothing on Facebook, for filling these sites with traffic-driving content. It’s hard to make a living when you’re a creative. Licensing is hard; the user experience is bad, so lawyers and middlemen extract the most value. In the music industry, more money flows into the pockets of distributors than creatives. Consumers are often happy to pay for their content. Instead, they're forced to sit through ads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

A principal may wish to establish his possession of a attestation, without revealing his complete identity. However, attestations should not be bearer instruments. An attestation must be issued in a way so that it is useless to anyone but the person to whom it was originally issued. This proposal provides a "forking" mechanism to issue attestations and spawn new identities from parent identities, in a way that attestations can be attributed to the spawned identity individually. The last section provides a federated mechanism for identities to establish their reputation data, both positive and negative, using a public blockchain. Forking is essential for this proposal, because this proposal gives a method to establish a complete history of a single identity’s actions, which could easily become public knowledge. A principal retains control only by spawning subidentities up to the finest level of activities that she wishes to be evaluated as a unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

An XDI graph can sometimes be serialized to JXD in different ways (some more verbose, some more compact), but deserializing a JXD back to XDI always results in the same original XDI graph. Every XDI graph can be serialized to JXD, and every JXD document can be deserialized to a valid XDI graph. An XDI graph is built from XDI context nodes, which form a semantic tree. In JXD, an XDI context node is represented as a JSON object, with an @id JSON object key set to the XDI context node’s address. A single XDI context node is described as a single JSON object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It's timestamping infrastructure with three big advantages over the existing alternatives: [^rewrite]: By "working on" I pretty much re-wrote the entire thing from scratch, adding a number of features that the previous architecture didn't easily support. [^first-commit]: OpenTimestamps is actually my first Bitcoin project: the earliest Git commits date back to June 8th 2012, a year and a half before I quit my job to work on Bitcoin full-time. Trust --- OpenTimestamps uses the decentralized, publicly auditable, Bitcoin blockchain, removing the need for trusted authorities; OpenTimestamps's architecture is designed to support multiple, cross-checked, notarization methods in the future. Cost --- OpenTimestamps scales indefinitely, allowing timestamps to be created for free by combining an unlimited number of timestamps into one Bitcoin transaction. Convenience --- OpenTimestamps can create a third-party-verifiable timestamp in about a second; you don't need to wait for a Bitcoin confirmation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Like money, reputation gives us access to opportunities, relationships, and resources. Reputation information about people's skills is primarily siloed into centralized systems like Linkedin and Upwork. Because of this the value of reputation on these platforms is limited, for both commerce and accreditation. This value may also disappear unexpectedly when centralized services shut down. Both users and platforms can increase the value of reputation "currency" by adopting portable reputation protocols.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

As with other ecosystems, different design decisions lead to different trade-offs. There is rarely one solution to a particular problem. Rather there tend to be a handful of solutions that make different trade-offs. This paper focuses on how privacy may be preserved using two different designs: same-origin identity and self-sovereign identity. We briefly analyze the trade-offs that come with each design approach in an attempt to progress a conversation in the community related to the appropriate path forward for a particular set of use cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This is problematic, because even highly-skilled end users have trouble maintaining the security posture required for safe key storage, as demonstrated by Bitcoin hacks -- now that stolen keys are worth money, we’re suddenly seeing a lot more keys get stolen, even from large companies with IT and security departments.

The Rebooting Web of Trust community should discuss how their use of the signature formats in Verifiable Claims could benefit from the design changes outlined in the rest of this paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I propose a definition of distributed identity that is  not only more self‐sovereign than card‐based approaches, it scales beyond web scale to allow every  individual and IoT device to both create and consume identity. Discovering the best user interface  idioms for managing distributed identity is a future exercise, but establishing the right conceptual  foundation for identity opens new landscapes for innovation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It would not only be an extreme success for a more user-centric social network to scale, but would be a shining example of how we could organize to create alternatives to other tech monopolies as well. Success may be improbable but the upsides are so great that it’s worth the risk. The fullness of “sovereign identity” is not likely to be realized with a single approach to all domains for identity on the Web. A P2P social media platform is a good focused use case to discuss self sovereign identity. Perhaps we can arrive at a sovereign identity solution for this single app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The ideas is to have an identifier, called a DID, which maps to a descriptor object (DDO) which contains a public key. This mapping can be done in a decentralized way using a blockchain, but other ways could be used as well. The point is that if the root of trust exists in a blockchain, this forms a decentralized PKI (or DPKI). A service interacting with a user would verify a signed message by looking up the DID of the user, mapping this DID to a corresponding key and verifying that the key matches the key that signed the message. In a certificate authority based identity system the root of trust is a root key held by a certificate authority (CA). The CA signs certificates containing the keys of sub-CAs which in turn signs keys used by end-users. Thus a service interacting with an end-user can receive a signed message, check the public key that signed the message and follow the certificate chain back to the root CA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

However, pre-defined trust on centralized instances is not always possible or wanted for trust management and the “web-of-trust” emerged as a decentralized alternative. It determines a trust value by aggregating reputations issued by other entities, where the reputations represent a subjective evaluation of the user satisfaction. This mechanism is also suitable for the identity management when using reputations to indicate (the subjective impression of) an identity’s trustworthiness. However, such traditional reputation-based web-of-trust approaches suffer from Sybil attacks, where an identity can increase the own trust value by creating synthetic identities issuing reputations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

DKMS inverts a core assumption of conventional PKI (public key infrastructure) architecture, namely that public key certificates will be issued by a relatively small number of centralized or federated certificate authorities (CAs). With DKMS, the initial “root of trust” for all participants is a distributed ledger that supports a new form of root identity record called a DID (decentralized identifier).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Users have a multitude of identities and associated credentials to manage, personal data is scattered across dozens of silos, and the last line of defense is almost invariably a password reset email. Within enterprises, federation eases this burden to some extent by centralizing many of the management aspects, but in the consumer world this added convenience can come with a considerable privacy trade-off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The first method specification to be completed will, besides clarifying the requirements for its domain, provide a baseline security and privacy consideration section, which other method specifications may refer to for examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability. The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This leads to the axiom about identifiers known as Zooko’s Triangle: "human-meaningful, decentralized, secure—pick any two". There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID starting from a human-friendly identifier—a natural language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a DID owner, such as a mobile telephone number, email address, Twitter handle, blog URL, etc. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is out-of-scope for this specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

In this network, a user’s identity profile resides in a data structure stored in a secure location under the control of the user but off the network itself. This identity profile contains attributes, each of which have been attested for by other users on the network, which uses a blockchain to verify that attestations and reputation scores are aggregated across the network correctly. An attestation from a user with a high reputation will be considered to have greater weight than an attestation from a user with a low reputation. Users are rewarded for making claims via attestations against other user’s credentials, but only if they are determined to be accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The Internet made possible to make a reputational statement by anyone on almost every object in the web, from people (Linkedin) to hotels (TripAdvisor). Whereas it is tempting to implement reputation on top of any identity system, a number of issues arise. The privacy problem is a major one: I may not want to disclose my recommendations in public, nor I want to show everyone who endorsed me, unless in private. In this article we explore possible ways to create and present proofs of reputation, which provide limited and owner-controlled information about reputation. We restrict to human beings only as we are primarily concerned with linkage between reputation and identity. First we identify some properties of reputation that are relevant to our study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This document describes a growing family of specifications that build on DIDs to provide other vital components of an interoperable decentralized identity infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This vision starts with a new way to establish and verify ownership of an idea and the intellectual property rights generated – coordinated by an intellectual property policy server and an immutable ledger for intellectual property rights. However, all of the transactions, licensing revenues, interests and equity generated by that intellectual property requires authentication, signatures, verification authorities and trustable timestamping. And so, self-sovereign identity and trust frameworks with algorithmic governance could be used to provide the identity infrastructure needed by the proposed system. Our goal is to work with the participants of this workshop to develop a model for integrating the IP Blockchain with self-sovereign identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Some of the applications of these systems are: Authentication Access Control Secure Service Provision (aka reputation systems for marketplaces etc.) Secure Routing Collaborative Intrusion Detection, etc. Probabilistic trust values (belief theory - subjective logic) can be calculated and propagated through the network. Blockchain technology (or Open Distributed Ledgers in general - ODLs as we like to call them) cannot alleviate the need for trust in entities altogether, but can help secure these trust infrastructures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The discussions surrounding these topics have led to a variety of technologies being developed that are mature enough to be organized into experimental solutions. During this meeting, we would like to focus on building experimental solutions for two primary use cases. These use cases are: Asserting a Verifiable Claim against a government-issued photo ID where the person asserting the claim can do so via a smartphone web browser. Onboarding a refugee into a Verifiable Claims account where a guardian oversees the refugee's account until the refugee acquires a device capable of enabling them to take control of their account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Quite simply, Andrieu says, "Identity is how we keep track of people and things and, in turn, how they keep track of us." It's an astute description that cuts through the confusion of what an identity database should or shouldn't encompass by instead suggesting that models need only include what's required for persistent identification. However, the content design of an identity system is only half the battle. There are also questions of jurisdiction, management, and oversight. In other words, once you have an identity system, who runs it, and who are they beholden to? That's where self-sovereign identity enters the picture, as an orthogonal way to look at the question of identity systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This document is a primer for those that want to learn about the Verifiable Claims initiative, the use cases and ecosystem, a basic overview of the technology, and how to get involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

BFTKV is a Byzantine fault tolerant key value storage that uses - PGP’s web of trust mechanism to build trust relationships between entities, - b-masking quorums to provide Byzantine fault tolerance and - Quorum certificates to restrict access to write operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The BTCR DID scheme uses a TX Ref-encoded (described below) transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. The DID Description is constructed from a combination of the transaction details and an optional "continuation" DID Description, the address of which is stored in the OP_RETURN field. This could be a link to an IPFS address of a DID Description with additional entities. The BTCR Hackathon readme has more context on BTCR DIDs beyond these basics. Note that at the time of the BTCR Hackathon, we were not yet using the new capabilities-based DID approach, so many details (e.g. control/owner keys) are out of date in the BTCR Hackathon repo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We should build this tooling as a community to reduce duplicated effort. The tooling that we create should first be targeted at developers so that they can easily integrate DIDs into their projects. Once we have built an acceptable number of low-level libraries and tools, we can move on to more customer-facing technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

We also expect Verifiable Claims to be carried over protocols such as HTTP, Bluetooth, and RFID. Over the years, Digital Bazaar has proposed various mechanisms that could be used to carry Verifiable Claims over browser-based protocols.

It’s an identity system thought out to fulfill all needs on the decentralized 3D Web, that requires a single global identity for all sites to make the experience seamless. The user experience to have a different avatar and profile for each site would be subpar. The DID is a content address that points to a DDO that is hosted as an RDF file in a decentralized file system such as IPFS, DAT or Swarm. The DDO can hold certificates that prove the information stated within it, but also the ownership of blockchain addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

But at a deeper level, DIDs are actually the tip of the iceberg -- or the tip of the spear -- of an entirely new layer of decentralized digital identity and public key infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. This decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) could have as much impact on global cybersecurity and cyberprivacy as the development of the SSL/TLS protocol for encrypted Web traffic (now the largest PKI in the world).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The W3C Credentials Community Group focuses on how privacy can be enhanced when attributes are shared electronically. In the course of our work, we have identified three related but distinct privacy enhancing strategies: "data minimization," "selective disclosure," and "progressive trust." These enhancements are enabled with cryptography. The goal of this paper is to enable decision makers, particularly non-technical ones, to gain a nuanced grasp of these enhancements along with some idea of how their enablers work. We describe them below in plain English, but with some rigor. This knowledge will enable readers of this paper to be better able to know when they need privacy enhancements, to select the type of enhancement needed, to assess techniques that enable those enhancements, and to adopt the correct enhancement for the correct use case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It is the goal of this paper to first identify the types of identity systems that have been created in the past as well as newly emerging identity systems. These identity systems can be used in many ways, but they often have many similarities allowing for the comparison of these identity systems. Outlined in this paper is a framework to make these comparisons by relying upon 4 categories that are apart of identity systems. They are verifiability, system architecture, accessibility, and security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Internet’s architecture mimicked the physical world, as issuers or central administrators were responsible for creating and managing large databases of validated user information. As a result, internet-based companies today require customers to a) fill out comprehensive online profiles with sensitive information and b) upload copies of physical documents to then spend millions of dollars in manual validation processes. For some companies, operating a large database of user data is an asset, but for many others is an expensive burden                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Is it properly countersigned by the subject?

Entities can use the system to safely authenticate each other and validate keys and certificates. Centralized key management systems (CKMS) manage key and certificate creation, signing, and validity. Specific problems arise when these authorities become unavailable, or the data they control becomes corrupted or known. Central authorities often become choice targets for attackers. This document proposes to meet these requirements with a decentralized blockchain ledger for providing an oracle of trust and leave control over all keys with end users. The use of a blockchain permits globally readable identifiers and public data to be shared in a secure manner that is not vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack or system wide compromise and permits consumers to be self-sovereign. This leaves consumers with the task of key management and protection. This document covers various ideas for how users may create, recover, backup, and revoke keys and provides recommended suggestions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Biometric authentication is increasingly being used on mobile devices to secure private keys and other sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) in some form of trusted platform module (TPM). While on-device biometrics (NOTE: Gartner refers to on-device biometrics as "local" biometrics) have advantages for service providers (who want to avoid risks associated with PII loss) and users (who feel they have control of their PII if it is locked on their device), it also has important disadvantages for both users and providers, namely presentation attacks, device attacks, loss of device, and theft. Revocation and recovery of associated credentials, accounts and other assets previously tied to on-device keys can be complex, error prone and subject to social engineering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The approach uses both transactional and non-transactional data. Non-transactional data includes both trust primitives such as verified claims as well as indeterminate trust assertions. We will also describe the potential use of incentive tokens for incremental optimization of the eco-system, in a manner that is especially suited for decentralized, self-sovereign eco-systems. Finally, we propose to discuss the complexities of online disagreements and how to resolve and adjudicate them in a pareto-optimal manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

We propose this could become a standard that will transform how information gets collected, evaluated, valued and exchanged to optimise Sustainable Development impacts. The context for this is the UN’s 17 Global Goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all, by 2030. To create a world that counts, the UN Secretary-General has called for a data revolution for sustainable development. The prototype Impact Claims specification is a core part of the ixo Protocol that provides a decentralised mechanism to generate verified impact data as a fungible asset that can be traded for funding and other forms of value-exchange. This protocol increases the accountability and transparency of impact funding and service provision, whilst also generating a dynamic data commons for sustainable development.

Sounds great - just replicate what they have. It isn't that simple. For one thing it is a global worldwide network that has evolved for 40 years.

For the Rebooting the Web of Trust workshop [1], we prefer a functional approach, focusing our conversation on how identity works and how it is used. The varied facets of identity are rich. We inevitably bring our own hot buttons and agendas to any discussion of “what identity is”. Some engage from a philosophical perspective, others psychological. Some dive into political or cultural issues, while others dissect the meta-physical and spiritual. These different perspectives are valid views of identity’s impact on our lives. More than valid. Vital. They help answer the question of “Why?” Why identity matters, why we should care. Unfortunately, they also inflame passions and we sometimes talk past each other to make points that seem irrelevant to others, leaving people frustrated and unheard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This poses problems when an attribute based credential system is to be used for arbitrary data graphs or schema definitions with optional fields, multi-valued fields or nested data structures, such as data schemas in wide use, documented on sites like schema.org. In an effort to allow JSON-LD data structures to leverage attribute based credentials and zero knowledge signature schemes, this paper outlines differences, requirements and possible options for representing JSON-LD data in attribute based credential schemes such as the one in use by the Sovrin network, implemented in the Hyperledger Indy project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

From the consumer perspective, since I am able to own my identity, I can divulge the age and identification requirements necessary to enter dispensaries. Regarding employment, the situation is more complex. As an employer, how would I access an employee’s employment history? If this person were blacklisted from other cannabis businesses, should I know? How? Later sections will explore how we plan on tackling this issue. Though identity will play a central role, governments are slow to respond. Some forward thinking governments have begun adopting decentralized identities, such as the city of Zug and Brazil.

It allows two DID owners to be able to mutually authenticate with a high degree of certainty (as long as the private key haven't been cracked, stolen, intercepted, etc) and can establish an ephemeral, secure, communication channel. The main concerns with TLS at this point is that established libraries such as OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and wolfSSL need slight modifications in order to run DID-TLS. In the intermediary, we could utilize this protocol to get Authentication through DIDs working, and then when the modifications in Open-TLS are accepted into the libraries, DID-Authentication could migrate to these libraries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

In the Ethereum community, a pattern known as ERC725 (see [2]) utilizes smart contracts for standard key management functions. We propose a new DID method that allows ERC725 identities to be treated as valid DIDs. One advantage of this DID method over others appears to be the ability to use the full flexibility of Ethereum smart contracts for key management purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

While theoretically useful, this definition unfortunately attempts to objectively assess something which is naturally subjective. Therefore, the main measure of an operational reputation system should be whether people voluntarily decide to use it. If so, it would follow that value has been added, either by lowering transaction costs or enabling trade that hadn’t been possible before. Additionally, a backwards-looking measure of success might be the predictive power of the model—did an agent defect when cooperation was predicted, and vice versa.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Let me know if i missed a thread and I will pull it in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

We must seek to make good use of this transformation and take the chance to implement a platform that is focused on humans. This is our chance to bring back the initial vision of the Internet, a decentralized network where the different peers had similar power, instead of most connections mainly going through the servers of very few big corporations. It is our chance to build a platform where users are treated as humans, truly owning the different aspects of their identity and without discrimination. It is our chance to build a user interface that is capable of blending physical and digital reality without turning humans into products. We need an open, safe and private platform for all technology that guarantees equal opportunities for everyone and provides a great experience. And the Web is a great starting point as it’s the most open and universal platform out there. Based on this philosophy, Holonet is a set of tools to make the Web the platform for ambient and immersive computing. Tools to act as a bridge from the current Web to the social 3D Web, where people own their identities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Members of each of these communities are maintaining mutual awareness of activities and are pushing these specifications toward better long-term compatibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

DIDs are decentralized and globally unique, but are intentionally not built to be human readable, and yet are meant to be used by humans.  Petnames offers a way forward by mapping local names to global identifiers and vice versa. By adding petnames as an additional layer to a globally unique and decentralized system, we are able to have names with all three properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

After the workshop ideas from the paper were reified into specification form and the W3C Credentials Community Group has taken on the specification as an official work item of the group. Some changes have happened in the design of Linked Data Capabilities from the initial Rebooting Web of Trust paper to the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Such information storage presents a single point of compromise from a security perspective. If this system is compromised it poses a direct threat to users digital identities. This paper proposes a decentralized authentication method, called the Horcrux1 protocol, in which there is no such single point of compromise. The protocol relies on decentralized identifiers (DIDs) under development by the W3C Verifiable Claims Community Group and the concept of selfsovereign identity. To accomplish this, we propose specification and implementation of a decentralized biometric credential storage option via blockchains using DIDs and DID documents within the IEEE 2410-2017 Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

(All Sovrin stewards are by definition trust anchors.) However the STF V1 did not define additional roles or specific mechanisms for implementing the Sovrin Web of Trust model, leaving that to the STF V2. Based on the learnings from V1 and the progression of open standards for self-sovereign identity (SSI)— specifically DIDs and Verifiable Credentials the Sovrin Trust Framework Working Group is now developing the STF V2. This second generation will fully define the roles and implementation mechanisms for the Sovrin Web of Trust. This short paper will describe the three primary roles in the Sovrin Web of Trust model. Note that most of the terms used here are further defined in the Sovrin Glossary. A visual depiction of how these three roles intertwine to create the Sovrin Web of Trust is shown in this diagram:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Open source technology is one model. A top-down model is for-profit companies join together to fund a non-profit to develop technology for use by by partner companies (e.g. SWIFT). A bottom-up model emerges from ad-hoc technology communities where bleeding edge and disruptive technology is explored as it is developed, mainly by technologists. Governments pursue their own R&D investment strategy that in effect, invest in technology commons with the end goal of encouraging diverse marketplace. Rebooting Web of Trust (RWoT), along with other events, is one of these bottom-up, ad-hoc technology commons. Participants build relationships with each other as they work together on projects. Results include whitepapers, development of technical specifications, and working code as proof of concepts. The results are part of the technology commons of RWoT and they are valuable, usable, and actively influence technology specifications, product development, and vision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Cryptographic technologies such as digital signatures can help improve trust in the authenticity of a document, but they don't solve all the problems. Digital records must be stored in a secure and durable media, which is often centralized within storage providers or private owned infrastructure. A blockchain network can be used to store these documents. It would offer a tamper-proof record of all transactions related to a diploma and it would have all relevant parties involved (educational institutions, learners, companies, government etc) working together, validating and endorsing these transactions to reach consensus regarding which documents are authentic and which ones should be rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In particular, the term is disliked by governments. I propose to develop a concept map during the RWOT sessions that attempts to describe the relationships between several terms that might be used to describe aspects of 'Self-sovereign Identity'. If successful, the concept map will help this community discuss the work in any other setting. The concept map will designed to be extended in order to capture terminology used in newly-engaged communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

At least minimal trusted publicity is required to help reduce fake identities (sybils) and their impact on social networks It enables democratic processes, specifically voting, in a fully decentralized and distributed way based on self sovereign identities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

One tempting approach might be 'a friend brings a friend' approach. A computer algorithm can then accept new members, if enough existing members endorsed them. However, can we trust this approach? When the community is big, and it can be as big as the global community of all humanity, it is not easy to identify the real members of the community, if there is no central authority to do so. In this case I claim not only that subjective trust won't help much in identifying the correct community members, but rather that an objective endorsement – one that does not require the endorser even to know the endorsed person – is the best key for establishing community membership. We call a graph of such endorsements, where the claims made by the signers are objective claims, a Trustless Web-of-trust (TWOT). In the global community of all humanity – the politician and the shy, or even the honest and the crook, should all have the same egalitarian membership within the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

In this paper we'll cover these topics going into details about what we refer to as the Agent to Agent protocol, how we're meeting the principles of self sovereign identity, and some of the shortcomings that need to be addressed still.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

While the establishment of various productive technology commons within a capitalist system continue- the shortcomings of duplicated efforts, siloed research, misaligned capital and the often dissident tension between Open Source and Intellectual Property create undue stress on managing collective effort. The aim of this paper topic is to explore how Curation Markets: the combination of Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs) and Token Bonding Curves (TBCs)) could create a tokenised attribution model to incentivise cross-collaboration and share the risks and rewards through distributed collective ownership for Commons like RWoT to more effectively coordinate and earn from value co-created around shared goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Imagine that you have invited friends to visit for the weekend and offer them the spare room in your home. You only have one key and you give it to them to come and go as they please. In technical terms, you have just given them an object capability, which is the key to your home. You instinctively know a number of things about this key: Authority - you know what this key opens (the front door) and doesn't open (the locked safe in your room). Restrictions - You know that they can use the key now, and that they won't be able to use the key after they return it to you. Delegation - The couple is free to hand the key off between each other without asking for your permission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Not only does it give full control but it also eliminates the knowledge required by the user to view their balances for different cryptocurrencies, viewing their transaction history, and also being able to provide a visual representation of their public address. Since we are living in the digital world of blockchain there is currently no definite way of representing a identity that is 100% true digitally and in the real world. However; by incorporating the concept of Web of Trust in a crypto wallet, an identity can be created to display throughout the entire web; the level of confidence there is in a specific address. Since cryptocurrency wallets can be considered a form of identity, functional identity can give us the framework in which to view this identity system based on how it works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This paper introduces the uninitiated to the requirements that have been identified over the years that are driving the community toward certain technological solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The following ideas describe how self-sovereign identity frameworks such as Sovrin [1] and Idemix [2] could enable individuals to issue pseudonymous claims backed by verifiable credentials regarding violations others have made, empowering whistleblowers with a new set of tools. This idea builds upon the previous work from the Rebooting Web of Trust III workshop's Portable Reputation Toolkit [3] on decentralized verification and certification. As violation claims can be a contentious issue, steps should be taken to protect the claim issuer’s identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

We envision such "DID Resolver" tools to become as central to SSI infrastructure as DNS is for the web today. Topics: There are different ways how an application or service can use a DID Resolver (e.g. as a natively linked library, or via an HTTP API). There are different ways how a DID Resolver can access a target system (e.g. direct access to a blockchain full node, access using a light client, or access via an intermediary blockchain explorer API). These different deployment scenarios have trust implications. Ideally an application or service should be as "close" to a DID Resolver as possible, and the DID Resolver should be as "close" to the target systems as possible, in order to minimize intermediaries and attack surfaces. A common topic is DID method governance, i.e. which DID methods should a DID Resolver support, and how should this question be governed (see here).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Our goal is to be able to recommend to our citizens and businesses Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) components that are both interoperable with what the Governments of BC and Ontario use and that meets expected privacy and security goals aligned with the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. A crucial first step in accomplishing that interoperablility is aligning the conventions being used in DIDs and DID Documents (DIDDocs) across DID Method ecosystems. The purpose of this paper is twofold - a pre-conference survey of progress made to this point on DIDDoc usage by each DID Method community, and then an attempt at RWoT to "compare and contrast" the different approaches to see what can be learned across the wider community and what alignment can be defined at this time that might lead to interoperability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context. That’s the functional approach to identity. How we think about these processes and assets is driven by why we use identity in the first place; our primary uses of identity shape our internal mental models, which in turn shape the kinds of solutions we build. Differing priorities and perspectives also make it challenging to discuss identity with people speaking from alternate mental models. We’ve identified five distinct mental models for identity, each with its own framing, its own purpose, and its own defining question. These are five valid, independent mental models of identity. By understanding them, we can better understand how apparently disjoint ideas of identity relate to each other, enabling the discussion and engineering of better, more broadly useful identity systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This way resolving the initial DID document from the DID is tautological - the DID is merely a representation of the data in the DID document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

How can one empower individuals as part of a collective identity, to individually act on behalf of the collective?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

However, there are certain applications that require the concept of trusted identities. At a minimum, all systems that involve voting rely on unique, trustworthy identities to cast a vote. This includes any consensus mechanism as well as any rating system. Such systems face a dilemma: how can we filter out bad actors without a centralized authority? In this paper, I propose the concept of deriving relative trust scores using a given trust metric, one score for each identity from the perspective of another, in a web of trust. I then offer as examples multiple trust metrics, propose the concept of relative reputation, and explore the the idea of obtaining social consensus from a web of trust using trust scores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Almost all of the current consensus algorithms, particularly on the public blockchains, provide only probabilistic guarantees of safety (against byzantine/malicious actors), and those guarantees depend on having a large enough verifier pool for the statistics to hold. Unfortunately, history provides many examples of first movers in a new technology not being the ones who survive in the end. The implication is that any of our current public blockchains (such as Bitcoin) might not be as popular, say, 20 years from now as they are today, resulting in a smaller participant pool and thus a greater safety risk. A way to move such assets, without requiring trust in a commercial asset pooling entity, might be beneficial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Ford, at the ƒcole polytechnique fŽdŽrale de Lausanne, Switzerland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In this "Presentation Request" a Verifier is able to define requirements towards the kind of Credential, Claims or ZKP Proofs that should be presented and if there are additional side constraints that need to be fulfilled. The proposed request defines a DSL to model constraints in a dynamic way, which the holder of Verifiable Credentials can match against its local store and identify satisfying or missing credentials. Lastly, the verifier utilizes the presentation request to setup an identifiable communication sequence by specifying key material and status endpoints for the transmission of request results (a set of matching Verifiable Presentations).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Due to meeting in person, the parties are not limited to using a widely-published (persistent) DID; they may create ephemeral identities on which they later reveal personal details. The goal of this position paper is to show an in-person contact exchange, and explore the basic user experience on which additional Verifiable Credential features may be attached.

Before computers, the paper-based transactions between patients and clinicians were not mediated by any institution. With the advent of practical standards-based self-sovereign technology, the agents of patients and licensed clinicians can restore this direct relationship. Health data is immensely valuable to both the individual and to society. Roche recently paid about $2,000 each for a million cancer patient’s records [Roche]. Our HIE of One (for health information exchange of one) Trustee project is an implementation of current standards and standards-track technologies for human agency and decentralized information governance. To be self-sovereign and practical, the Trustee agent must not only be entirely under control of the individual, but the agent must also be acceptable to the institutions that sell goods and services to the individual. In this paper, we describe the design of a self-sovereign health record for the homeless and our interaction with a major academic medical center that will need to work with it.

Miller, Christopher Lemmer Webber, and others during the 2018 Santa Barbara RWoT. Unique identifiers (such as public keys and public key hashes) are often not human readable. The lack of human readable names creates significant usability problems. Petname systems have been proposed as a solution. Petnames are names that are "secure, memorable, and private to the individual who refers to another entity... True petnames are 2-way associative: given a petname in a specific application on a specific machine, you can acquire the key, and given the key, you can acquire the petname. The mapping back from the key to the petname is always performed when presenting data to the user". (Stiegler) The address book in a cell phone is an example of petnames mapping to phone numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The potential for use of cryptographic and digital identity standards in decentralized systems illustrates this point. Microsoft is deeply engaged with numerous innovators in building decentralized public-key based identity systems prototypes and is excited at the possibilities. We love what’s happening and the way innovators are coming together to enable new digital identity possibilities. All of us want these possibilities to achieve their promise as quickly as possible. Integrating and maintaining interoperability with existing identity management systems – all based on standards – will be key to accelerating this process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In such an environment, it’s impossible to prevent the creation of multiple accounts. Instead, it needs to be difficult to accumulate sufficient reputation across many accounts. An account’s reputation score can then act as the probability that it belongs to an individual. In order to limit actions to unique people, applications building on top would specify the score required to participate. Reputation would most likely be acquired through a Web-of-Trust model. As users trust each other (verify that they are unique), a strong network of relationships forms. The system could then use the topology the network to generate a reputation score, similar to PageRank. In order to output a global score, you would need to “anchor” to some trusted accounts, in order differentiate the real network from shadow networks of fake accounts, who all trust each other, but aren’t connected to legitimate accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

In general, how do they know the display matches the content? This is currently addressed in a variety of (sometimes incomplete) ways. This paper surveys existing solutions to the problem, and develops a set of requirements based on lessons learned. This proposes a general solution based on the authors' experiences developing Blockcerts and Validbook. We use the term "verifiable displays" to describe the end goal, which is avoiding a category of social engineering attacks introduced by the potential gap between content and its renderings in a human-readable display.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

These systems perform all the complex cryptographic algorithms on a user's behalf, communicate with all involved parties, and are responsible for safeguarding the information. Developed countries such as those in Europe and North America have no problem using these platforms, these solutions exclude parts of the word that do not have the same sophistication. For example, the vast majority of Africa does not have access to the internet. Many Africa locations that do, connection speeds are incredibly slow. There are also possible scenarios where a computer system may not be available to individuals like refugees.

But at a deeper level, DIDs are the core component of an entirely new layer of decentralized digital identity and public key infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. This decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) could have as much impact on global cybersecurity and cyberprivacy as the development of the SSL/TLS protocol for encrypted Web traffic (now the largest PKI in the world). This primer is designed to give newcomers to DID architecture the background they need to understand not just the DID specification, but the overall architecture for decentralized identity represented by the family of DID-related specifications currently under development. It covers: Background on the origin of DIDs and the DID specification. How DIDs differ from other globally-unique identifiers.

Since then stakeholders across the country have tried and tested solutions to address the issue. These responses, largely based on the provision of emergency services, have prevented meaningful progress. Fortunately, there are many signs that we are entering a new phase -- one that will lead to an end to homelessness in Canada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This enables the verification of a given data flow and the trustworthiness of output data. As the output data are used by several mobility control, risk and business systems it is important that any entity can evaluate the trustworthiness of a given output data set. The decentralized identifier (DID) is a new open standard type of globally unique identifier that offers a model for lifetime scope, portable digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and that can never be taken away by third parties. We are using DIDs as a standard identifier in our solution which is supported by the W3C community. Our approach uses cryptographic data structures to link data objects and to establish a method for data flow provenance [1]. By data flow provenance we mean a mechanism for tracing data item content and control through a processing system including any transformation to the data item. This includes flows with multiple sources, collective sensor fusion and processing by machine learning algorithms. Data flow provenance means not just tracing control but also verifying the end-to-end integrity of every data flow including any transformations (additions, deletions, modifications, combinations, and ML processing). When a DID and hence data chain of the resultant data is extended to machines, the provenance chain of the data flow can provide the basis for verifiable claims and attestations about the data flow itself as well as for reputation mechanisms. These novel verifiable data chains and reputation mechanisms allow to asses trustworthiness, reliability or risk metrics of a given output of a data chain. The applications of verifiable data chains stretch across multiple use cases including real-time vehicle value, dangerous driving, road and obstacle mapping, usage-based insurance (UBI), reliable feedback loops into driver assistance system (DAS) and autonomous driving infrastructures, V2V/V2I interactions and cooperative mobility systems. Benefits of data provenance along a digitized value chain include: reliability of data and ML labels in distributed systems increased safety maximized efficiency with less congestion, impact, costs and better services. Our verifiable data chain concept supports the overall goal to demonstrate the working BC/DLT technology components can be used and scaled today for data provenance in digital value chains.|

Resolvable—associated with standard metadata describing the identified entity Cryptographically-verifiable—the DID controller can prove ownership using private keys Decentralized—no centralized registration authority needed. DIDs can be supported on any modern blockchain or distributed ledger by creating a DID method for that target system. Each DID method operates in its own DID namespace. DID method names can be nested within a namespace just like other hierarchical name systems, e.g., DNS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The protocol is broadly designed to work with all aspects of trust; this includes identity, reputation, and security. The protocol is designed to be independent of specific systems and is very minimalistic. The intention is to extend the protocol with layers above rather than direct implementations. The protocol claim message data is designed to be self-provable of authenticity, by use of private/public key algorithms and the blockchain timestamping feature. This enables the protocol to be decentralized without a need for central authority, as servers can use a peer-to-peer communication system and verify all the data it receives individually, without having to rely on the sender. The Protocol allows anyone, including automated software, to issue their own cryptographic identities, for the use of trust and reputation and be able to verify those of others, without the need for a trusted third party. Users issue claims to other identities, and this way build a personal web of trust network. Users can search for claims on subjects by use of the user's trust network. The search only include results from trusted sources, claims from untrusted sources are not returned. The system is resistant to attacks like Sybil and bot networks as they are usually not a part of the uses networks and therefore not considered when evaluating searches. The system works on the incentive of the user’s reputation and established trust, to be a good actor within their networks, since no one will listen to them if no one trusts them. It is possible to trust anything digitally, and therefore the protocol suitable to be used for anything that requires some degree of trust shared between systems related or unrelated. The DTP protocol is ideal for identity, reputation and security management that needs to be used in a broader sense without a central authority and furthermore it can augment existing systems already in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, in order to attain massive user adoption, these decentralized applications need to be better than the incumbents in almost every aspect -- usability being the one where they usually lack the most. Most of the cryptographic identity solutions out there rely on a single key pair where the public key identifies a single identity. While simple, this solution has many drawbacks, the most important one being that you can't recover your identity if the private key gets compromised. To explore potential solutions, the IPFS DDC WG decided to invest some time researching what decentralized identity solutions may be used. This paper is a follow-up of RFC Peer-Star-Identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

During development of standard DID method specifications, and while exploring certain DID-related use cases, there has arisen the notion of a "ledgerless" DID, i.e. a DID that is not anchored to any infrastructure. We call these peer to peer (P2P) DIDs because the first use cases that explored the need for ledgerless DID were peer to peer messaging scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Of course, this could be done with a new DID-specific protocol. However, there already exist standard protocols for proving ownership of a public/private key pair. The OpenID Connect specification defines [Self-Issued Identities(https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued) in Section 7. A self-issued identity is represented by a public/private key pair. Logging in with the self-issued identity proves control of the private key. Microsoft is experimenting with using self-issued identities to prove ownership of DIDs. This is straightforward. The DID key is used as the key for the self-issued identity. The self-issued identity is validated in the standard way. In addition, a "did" claim containing the DID identifier is added to the self-issued ID Token. This enables relying parties that understand that the self-issued identity is also a DID to perform DID operations after control of the key has been verified using OpenID Connect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I provide a brief overview of the BTCR DID resolution method, point to the problem of querying third party services and how we provided our own community service as part of a hackathon in 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This is in large part due to our ability to effectively communicate by resolving these DIDs. The process of obtaining a DID Document associated with a particular DID is outlined in the DID Resolution spec. A blockchain-agnostic implementation of the spec is hosted at the Decentralized Identity Foundation and is fully open-sourced. The Universal Resolver can be found at its website and also runs locally or remotely through an API. It currently supports DIDs on Sovrin, BTCR, uPort, Jolocom, Veres One, ERC-725, Blockstack, IPFS, and DNS via a number of community-contributed drivers built on top of the Universal Resolver. Now that we can universally resolve a DID, how can we do the same with the entire DID lifecycle? All DID methods commonly share 4 operations: Create, Resolve, Update, and Revoke. We can envision a counterpart to the Resolver, called a Registrar, that contains these additional DID operations. DID Resolution is relatively straightforward because there is no authentication required and thus no keys involved. In addition, it is an atomic operation and can easily be done over the web. Creating a DID, updating its DID Document and revoking a DID's secret will require the same abstraction layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

We need to configure a list of identity references such as the certificate's subjects or issuers. To describe the identity reference with PKI, we use X.500 Distinguished Name style strings. Suppose we want to add support for DID in a client authentication server code like the above. We need to modify the access control code of the server to add support for DID resolution. If we have a DID resolver library to implement this, it is not a difficult task. However, if we want broader deployment of DID, we need to develop a better way to add support for DID to help application developers. If we look at how to treat identity reference in an application, it is natural to develop a standard abstract data type which may store a different kind of identity references. Key Idea One of the ways to support references for multiple ID scheme everywhere is developing a general Universal ID Reference scheme, which covers not only the references to DID but also Distinguish Name-based scheme or possibly others. It is possible to develop a Universal ID framework consists of standard documents, open source libraries, and other necessary components to help using Universal ID-based system. Possible outcomes If the Universal ID based framework is ready and the traditional single-framework component is replaced with mutiple-framework capable component, it will be able to seamlessly support both DID and PKI based trust system. This change effectively enables the use of DIDs in various places.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Impacts of this complexity include: Biasing new projects towards build-from-scratch versus build-upon Forcing focus on infrastructure and edge tech, rather than VC-ecosystem flows Blocking effective cross-system evaluation and interoperability work Pushing UX into products and delaying UX development I propose use of the Jupyterlab interactive computing environment as a means of: facilitating broad adoption promoting interoperability supporting SSI UX development expanding the number of documented use-cases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This not only facilitates our work as we avoid the (endless) terminological discussions, but also helps us to deepen our understanding of what we are actually doing. This model, which we refer to as a Self-Sovereign Identity Framework or SSIF, is a work that is still in progress, but where the basics seem to have become stable. In this two-pager, we introduce the purpose for the model, its use, and a (new) definition of the term 'definition', which we need to make it all work. Additionally, a draft text is made available in which most of our current thinking about SSI is expressed. I would like to discuss this approach and what we might do to make it beneficial to all of us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

In many aspects the SSI sector is attempting to create a ‘Blue Ocean’ strategy to shift the competitive landscape on identity in the digital realm to redefine digital identity to one of personal control. In doing so, it creates as potential competitors not only the traditional identity software providers, but also commercial enterprises that have tied control of identity into their business models (Google, Facebook). The SSI community it not some recent creation, but has evolved out of a group of individuals that have been long active in the realm of Internet identity. With the creation of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) a fundamental technology has come into the market that so far appears to enable a degree of decentralization and control that has heretofore not been achievable. As a relatively newcomer to the digital identity space, what has struck me is how passionate and tight knit this community is; over the past six months I have read, observed and spoken with many different members of different SSI projects, and the striking feature is that there exists a strong ethos of cooperation while seeking the strongest technical solutions for the sector. There are strong passions and opinions around the right and wrong way to describe or do things, but these differences are always expressed in a manner conducive to creative dissonance with the objective of creating something much better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This is why we nurture projects helping individuals amplify their potential through open systems that expand our collective mind at local, regional and global scales. We have a problem and an opportunity currently labelled "personal data". The opportunity encompasses nothing less than a complete redesign of our lives and societies and our collective ability to grapple with complex adaptive systems including super-wicked problems — but this will remain elusive until we've wrestled with the "personal data" problem, including the problem of the way we frame the opportunity and problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

On one hand, our trajectory points toward a future of sustainable solutions built in the context of collaborative networks based on communication between these identities. On the other hand, it appears that rather than "owning" our identities, we are increasingly owned by them -aggregated and dependent. This limits the range of possibilities for emergent conversations and solutions. In light of this, I hope to present some work that involves exploring the features of this terrain, with an eye to seeing how we might move toward greater freedom from the limitations of current models of identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This paper explores the aforementioned frameworks in the context of the emerging human-centred data economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Protocols like OpenID Connect (OIDC) [OIDC] respectively OAuth2 and the Security Markup Language (SAML) Web Browser SSO profile is mostly used in this area. For example, behind the scenes, Google uses the OIDC protocol in their sign-in button. After user authentication and consent, and depending on the flow, clients, i.e., Relying Parties (RP), will receive up to three different tokens, i.e., id token, refresh token, access token. The RP will use these tokens with the IdP to obtain data about the user: The id token can already contain personally identifiable information, i.e., the requested data about the user. The access token (typically a bearer token) provides access to the user info endpoint, which allows the RP to request or refresh the required data. The IdP usually hosts the user info endpoint. Because access tokens are valid for a shorter period, the refresh token could be used to obtain a new access token. This approach typically has an impact on the user’s privacy by allowing the OpenID Connect Provider (OP) to track the user's behavior. Furthermore, relying on a bearer token has also security implications. Of course, mechanisms like token binding exist to mitigate the security issues, but they are still not common practice. While SAML loses its importance, OIDC is still there, actively maintained, and has a lot of support from the industry and many independent OIDC client implementations are available. Depending on the area, e.g., telcos or government, dedicated OIDC profiles were created that specifically address their requirements. An OIDC profile is a specific conformity configuration of pieces of the OIDC specifications, e.g., flows, parameters. While the traditional IdP approach has a lot of downsides, the underlying OIDC protocol could provide enough flexibility to support SSI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Furthermore, we show how hashing the shares also protects the message integrity, but is vulnerable to a cheating dealer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

That is, individual shares contain absolutely no semantic information about the secret, and it can be said to be 'post quantum' cryptography. An interesting anecdote, the root key for ICANN DNS security, effectively the key which secures the naming system of the internet, is held by seven parties, based in Britain, the U.S., Burkina Faso, Trinidad and Tobago, Canada, China, and the Czech Republic. Cryptographer Bruce Schneier has alleged that they are holders of Shamir's secret shares, which indicates the scheme is taken quite seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

These identities can be verifiable due to the cryptographic attestations that can be made. For example, A DID can be signed by an entity, such as a government, to improve the quality and reliability of information attached to the identity. A DID can be anchored to a public blockchain which acts as a registry. Interrogating a public blockchain allows a user to find, reference, revoke or update a DID. Only the user possessing cryptographic evidence to a DID can make state changes and prove ownership. Services that implement DID infrastructure allow users to be the source of truth for their online identity, removing ownership from third parties or other central authorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Being assigned one would give them better access to the work market since just their physical presence and knowledge is not enough in many cases, but rather we require proof for education and experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Many of these are non-technical and such, should be explored in multi-disciplanary way. We propose a human centered design approach to tackle some of these issues and help shift the focus to not just the technical feasibility, but also inclusive usability. This is a prerequisite to creating an identity system which combines technical and human trust elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

VCs with ledger provide, as a further value, just VC revocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

While still making it simple enough for all the users and keeping the needed level of trustworthiness. Sharing is what provides the end value for both the verifying and the sharing party. If there is no sharing, the issuance of the VC has gone to waste. Hence if we are to provide value for the sharing party today, we have to ask the questions of where is this adopted, how can we make this adoption effortless? Can we put most of the work on the service providers? Is the user or another service expected to install software? If so, install software where? Is that software domain-specific or integrated with some existing software?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The method relies on quantifying attention flows between identities. It is predicated on the fact that attention is a basic element of all cognitive processes.
