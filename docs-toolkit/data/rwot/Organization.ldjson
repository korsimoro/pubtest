Miss Lane entered into the blockchain and digital currency industry in 2011 after spending three months in silent, transcendental meditation with a buddhist monk. She came back to society curious to understand the logical structures underpinning \"reality\", such as politics, economics and philosophy. During her continued period of study, Toni Lane sensed an oncoming dissolution of many \u201cprincipled\u201d theories, like democracy, based on the modern day disconnect from real world practice and founding theory of logic. Archaic human rationality encouraged the prevalence of threats, scarcity, and violence to survive as the myopic heartbeat of governing principles; this could not continue. Should fear rule over self-sovereignty, self-actualization, community and deep empathy, characteristics Miss Lane understood to be basic responsibilities of being alive, the democracy bubble was going to pop. Toni Lane came in contact with blockchain technology in 2011, and she was hooked. Notably, Toni is working on CULTU.RE, creating competitive marketplaces for governance and standards for self-sovereign identity. As a humanitarian, Toni Lane used Bitcoin as a tool for direct response to the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone. Toni Lane is a co-founder of CoinTelegraph, one of the largest media networks in the blockchain industry, and an advisor at over 15 companies in the blockchain space. Miss Lane serves as a thought leader for many prestigious organizations including: SingularityU, IFTF, P&G, Cisco, HSBC and the United Nations (which she believes should not take money from dictators, nor should they allow member states to appoint a nation as a \"womens/human rights representative\" if it is culturally unacceptable for a woman in that country to drive a car).  \u2028In other worlds, Toni Lane lives the life of an artist. As a vocalist, Toni Lane recently performed Chelsea Hotel #2 at the tribute to Leonard Cohen in the Hotel Chelsea. As a poet, Miss Lane is working on publishing her first collection entitled, \u201cEUPHORIA SPEAKING\u201d. To shift paradigms in the art world, Toni Lane has founded the \u201cimmateralism\u201d (post art) movement. Post Art (Immaterialism) uses consciousness as a medium. The art pieces Miss Lane showcases are other people. Examples of her work can be seen through readings of extreme empaths, rain dances, shared dreaming, and tangible, evidence based works of art showcasing the conscious ability to transcend illusions of time and space. Her work as an artist is focused on giving scientists evidence of the unknown; unlocking forgotten knowledge in our consciousness to guide the next generation of scientific discovery.", "Image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloud.kumu.io/accounts/169502/111101/080ac4de-54ce-4d57-b868-00dd4fef24b7.jpg", "Url": "https://www.tonilane.com/", "Organization Type": "Service Company", "Description": "Toni Lane is an artrepreneur in the Digital Currency | Blockchain Industry, and well-respected leader in the movement for global sovereign unity.
