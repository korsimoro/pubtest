# Decentralized Identifiers v1.0

The Decentralized Identifiers specification editors and implementers
spent some time at Rebooting the Web of Trust 6 processing the
[remaining issues](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/issues)
in the issue tracker.

This document summarizes the proposed resolutions that the group has
put forward to resolve all of the DID specification issues that were submitted
before 2018-03-05.

## Next Steps

The group expects that work will continue during the
[W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/)
meetings over the next several months, with a plan to take the specification on
the W3C Standards track by Q4 2018. The following work items will be needed
to progress onto the W3C Standards track:

* DID Primer for W3C Members
* W3C DID Working Group Charter Proposal
* DID Use Cases (focus on 3-5 use cases)
* DID Specification
* Test Suite for DID Specification
