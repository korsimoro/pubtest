I have a confession to make - I see graphs everywhere. Even in the places where other people do not see them. I do not remember when exactly I started to see them. Probably around the time when I begin to think that [Identity is a Graph of Claims](https://medium.com/@drabiv/identity-is-a-graph-of-claims-69b8df061a65), or maybe when I saw [this  image](https://www.ayalpinkus.nl/shinglejs/_sample.html) at put it at the home page of [Validbook / The United Humans services POC](http://futurama1x.validbook.org/) as a symbol of humanity. 

Now I cannot get rid of seeing everything as graphs - our universe, our societies, families, our bodies and most obviously our brains made of billions of neurons. If you think about this, even human consciousness, thoughts and the perception of beauty are undeniably just  dynamic changes in the graph of neurons. Graph analysis is going to help us understand the biggest scientific secrets out there (brain, economies, universe).

I wanted to share this insight of seeing everything as graphs with RWOT community, as this way of looking at things makes it easier to understand DIDs/VCs/WOTs systems.

Identity, verifiable claims, WOT/PKIs, etc are nothing but graphs of claims and in order for them to become meaningful/verified/secured they have to be traversed. Thus the task of DIDs/VCs/WOTs designer/architect comes down to creating the most effective/optimal graphs and respective graph traversal tools.

Also, I'd love to find people, who share this passion for graphs, to explore applicability of different graph analysis methods and tools to various RWOT-related interests.
