# Rebooting the Web of Trust

We were building on ideas of PGP, and have now run five RWOT workshops.

We want to create a new architecture that supports

   * Self-Administrated, Self-Sovereign

We've had good results so far.

## Innovation Pipeline

Ideas are generated before RWOT at IIW,EIC and other places.

We work on things here, doing incubation.

The work is then refined at W3C Community Groups, DIF

And then ideas are standardized at W3C, IETF, OASIS

## Participating

We are building this future together!

Be respectful, constructive, and have fun.

And if something goes wrong, _let us know!_
