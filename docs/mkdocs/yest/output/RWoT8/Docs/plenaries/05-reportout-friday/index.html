    <h1 id="initial-group-abstracts">Initial Group Abstracts</h1>
<h2 id="incentivizing-decentralized-collaboration-chris">Incentivizing Decentralized Collaboration (Chris)</h2>
<p>How do you incentivize beneficial collaboration</p>
<h2 id="driving-adoption-based-on-basic-human-needs-sam">Driving Adoption Based on Basic Human Needs (Sam)</h2>
<p>User journeys. Safety and security are basic human needs. We need to
create win-win situations with VCs.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>(Postponed decision for abstract and to write paper.)</p>
<h2 id="satyrn-joe-code">Satyrn (Joe) â€” CODE</h2>
<p>Markdown file format with interactive code, teaching and testing
node.js modules.</p>
<h2 id="did-spec-work-manu">DID Spec Work (Manu)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Triaging issues</li>
<li>Splitting up into editorial work</li>
<li>Continuing on refinement of spec</li>
<li>Producing a work plan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="universal-pluralism-boris">Universal Pluralism (Boris)</h2>
<p>Can we create a global legal framework based on network of networks:
local frameworks that are interoperable.</p>
<h2 id="osidid-interoperability">OSI/DID Interoperability</h2>
<p>Reuse OpenConnect to prove ownership of a DID: describe how and why.</p>
<h2 id="did-key-management-in-the-group">DID Key Management in the Group</h2>
<p>Examines specific requirements for DID on the web, plus limitations,
and how they apply to DID key management.</p>
<h2 id="social-key-recovery-chris">Social key Recovery (Chris)</h2>
<p>Two outputs planned:
1.  Low-hanging fruit for improvements to Shamir (CODE)
2. Survey of issues, opportunities, and risks for the future of social-key recovery beyond Shamir.</p>
<h2 id="human-meaningful-names-for-ss-i">Human-meaningful Names for SS-I</h2>
<p>Had a long discussion about whether human-meaningful names serve a
purpose. They're not technically necessary, but they might be nice.</p>
<p>Came up with a spec, but discovered that Blockstack had already done it!</p>
<p>(deciding whether to continue or not.)</p>
<p>General discussion: it's a hard, hard problem, but a good one. And
we'd like to have something that doesn't depend on one company.</p>
<p>Maybe talking about the history of it itself would be a good paper.</p>
<p>(A Pitfall Primer??)</p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping-an-ss-i-framework">Bootstrapping an SS-I Framework</h2>
<p>Though the tech has matured, bootstrapped an SS-I framework at scale
hasn't happened. This paper will outline paths to adoption.</p>
<p>US Health Care System use case.</p>
<h2 id="framework-to-assess-value-of-self-issued-credentials">Framework to Assess Value of Self-Issued Credentials</h2>
<p>How and when could they make sense? Principals?</p>
<ol>
<li>Should be invested in by issuer.</li>
<li>Should be scarce.</li>
<li>Can be signed by others to increase assurances.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="journalism-use-cases">Journalism Use Cases</h2>
<p>Journalism as an industry-specific issuer.</p>
<h2 id="verifiable-credential-test-corpus-ryan">Verifiable Credential Test Corpus (Ryan)</h2>
<p>A playground or museum.</p>
<p>We need a corpus of claims that can be tested for success or failure.</p>
<p>(There will be two abstracts for this, covering different areas.)</p>

<p>Working on illustrations</p>
<h2 id="peer-to-peer-did-method-spec">Peer-to-Peer DID Method Spec</h2>
