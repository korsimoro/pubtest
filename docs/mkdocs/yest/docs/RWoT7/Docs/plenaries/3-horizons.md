# Three Horizons

This exercise is intended to look around corners and see connections we wouldn't expect.

## Overview

   * Horizon 1: Business as Usual — what's active today, what we expect and assume will always be here
   * Horizon 3: The Future We Want — break with the current paradigm
   * Horizon 2: Emergent, Disruptive Phenomenon — not what we have or want, but it fills the gap between today and tomorrow

## Horizons for Digital Identity

### Horizon 1

What is dying and how can we let it go and leave well?

   * What is business as usual?
   * How did we get here?
   * Why do we believe this is failing?
   * Is there anything valuable about this system that we want to retain?

### Horizon 3

What is being born and how can we help it arrive well?

   * What is the future we want to bring about?
   * What are the seeds of the future in the present?
   * Whose work are these possibilities built upon?
   * How can this be valued + shared?
   * What are competing visions of the future?

### Horizon 2

What is being disrupted and how can it be harnessed for the future we want (vs. capture to create a future we don't want)?

   * What is being disruptive?
   * What are the roots of this disruption?
   * What kind of guidance can you set for yourself to influence whether your disruption actually helps create the future you/we want?
