**GROUP 1**

Humancentric, for people not gov't
Human-oriented usability

We change our identity ship: so that it's owned by people, not gov't by the end

There will be multiple identity solutions, but there should be a common substrate
- We shouldn't touch reputation, because it's a third rail

There will be more smaller states in future

**_Things That Will Help_**
- System of identity pointers that are self-sovereign
- Decentralized system of containers for identity
- Verifiable claims that can create strong n-dimensional links between entities

**GROUP 2**

Identity is expansive
- Used for more
- Might have multiple identity
- Has to be dynamic
- Could be multiple people with identities

There will be an _available_ global UN ID
- But will not be most people's normal ID

Anonymity is a problem 
- Should be able to opt-out
- Blockchain can be troublesome for privacy due to future advances
- So even encrypted data should be stored off-chain

**GROUP 3**

We will be individuals or digital selves, not users
- We are participants, not consumers
- Organizations are not providers, they're identity consumers
- Reserve the right to opt-out and go dark

The gap of identity symmetry will be closed
- But there will need to be incentives

The main difference was what happens with the natural world: is it better or does it have like the digital world?

Gov't and organization recognizing identities they didn't create will be the big change: interoperability!

**GROUP 4**

Identification needs to become a process
Algorithmic Identity Bots will create identity under control of original source

A lot of difference over uses of biometric technologies

Is this really a tech set of challenges or humanistic?

Is this a problem about humans needing identity or a problem about machines needing identity?

Adoption will be driven by commercial adoption.

**GROUP 5**

1. Personas will be first-class identity. Identification is no longer required for authentication. People won't _need_ to know who you are as a human to use services.
2. Informal reputation, based on attestations, will be more releavant than legal identity.
3. Keys and key management will be intuitive and under the control of an individual.
4. There will be dynamic webs of trust, which may help us find people with same attibutes.
5. Post offices will play a pivotal role. (Or maybe can do through reputation, not gov't.)

**GROUP 6**

Hope to have definition of use cases
And what identity is
Need to define the minimal claim set

We need to talk to users to learn what identity is

Legal system needs to catch up with technology!
- Are we digital as human beings?

Biometrics once more the elephant in the room
- Believe they can be username, not password.

Need a user-centric system
- Needs to serve the needs of humans, not the gov't

Need a context-specific identity system

**GROUP 7**

Identities is a process, not a data structure
- Different needs for different situations

Self-sovereign Identity
- Digital selfie!
- Self issue identifier
- Ornaments (attributes) are what you attach
- If stolen, just reconstruct
- Some attributes not valid if not signed by related entity (e.g., MIT degree)

Biometrics switch over time
