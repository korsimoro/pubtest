The recent experience around the application for the W3C DID WG status with Use Cases documentation, suggests that it might be 
useful to take a step back and reflect on what may be the reasons for the RWOT/SSI community to ‘miss the wave’ 
that appears to be forming under/around identity.

The identity community is a small and very active, levels of participation and engagement are high, 
but it is small and thoughts, concepts and opinions do risk an echo chamber reinforcement effect. In the midst of 
the chamber it is hard to see or hear outside dynamics that may be threatening the space.  It is only when one
deliberately 'gets on the balcony' to observe the field at large can outside elements and forces begin to be seen.

The proposal of this topic is to do a Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threat (SWOT) analysis 
around the space at large to surface any areas that need attention in order to reduce the risk of surprise and 
having the market be coopted or have it move off in another direction.

The goal is to avoid the famous Maxwell Smart quote: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPwrodxghrw
