    <p><strong>Rebranding the Web of Trust</strong> (Dave, Shannon)</p>
<p>Mainly a semantic exercise. Might have helped some people within the workshop, but wasn't that impactful beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>Satisfying Real World Use Cases</strong> (Drummond)</p>
<p>Several use cases, some of which were related to ID2020.</p>
<p>Has had some impact on W3C: Verify Credentials, which was looking for use cases.</p>
<p><strong>DPKI</strong> (Greg, Markus, Jude, Christian)</p>
<p>Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure
Used Blockchain technology </p>
<p>Impact: started looking to creating a system that's more general
With different underlying architectures</p>
<p>Has pioneered a few interesting ideas, especially identifiers (human-readable vs machine-readable)
Introduced a metric of decentralization</p>
<p>Some people are now officially working on it through a series of grants</p>
<p>A paper was also accepted to USENIX containing some of these core concepts</p>
<p><strong>Smart Signatures</strong> (Chris)</p>
<p>Simple code that at the end verifies or doesn't verify.</p>
<p>Have begun to work on a language to allow for more complex options. </p>
<p>Topic paper of DEX was submitted for this conference.</p>
<p>Impact: people are beginning to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>What's Next</strong> (Chris, Shannon)</p>
<p>We need leaders for papers to make it easy to edit them at the end.</p>
<p>Shannon's prefered process:</p>
<ol>
<li>An editor takes control of the paper post-workshop</li>
<li>The editor queries Shannon (shannona@skotos.net) for any help needed in writing or editing of paper</li>
<li>At the end, editor hands Shannon final paper for editing</li>
<li>The editor includes rough drawings that they would like made into professional line drawings</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback on Last Time</strong></p>
<p>Talk about problems, not solutions when forming groups</p>
<p>Don't become a standards organization: this is a knowledge hackathon</p>
<p>We <em>did</em> have successes last time, including $200k in funding, a UN event, interaction with Blockstack, rolled out onto Azure.</p>
