<p><strong><em>by Manu Sporny, Dave Longley, and Matt Collier, Digital Bazaar</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Veres One Ledger is a permissionless public ledger designed specifically 
for the creation and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Veres 
One DIDs are self-sovereign identifiers that may be used by people, 
organizations, and digital devices to establish an identifier that is 
under their control. </p>
<p>Veres One DIDs are useful in ecosystems where one needs to issue, store, and 
use Verifiable Claims. </p>
<p>The Veres One DID Method specification has been implemented and a
testnet is available here:</p>
<p><a href="https://testnet.veres.one/">Veres One Testnet</a></p>
<p>There is a video demo of a DID being registered and retrieved from the
Veres One Testnet here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQzQKZKF93w">Veres One Testnet DID Registration Demo</a></p>
<p>The current draft of the Veres One DID Method specification is available here:</p>
<p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-veres-one/">Veres One DID Method Specification</a></p>
<h2 id="an-example-veres-one-did-document">An Example Veres One DID Document</h2>
<p>What follows is a complete DID Document registration event that is sent to the ledger
including line by line documentation regarding the DID Document registration
event.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>We would like to collaborate with the other DID Method implementers at 
Rebooting the Web of Trust to align both the core DID specification as well
as other DID Method specifications. We are also seeking to partner with
organizations that would be interested in integrating Veres One DIDs into their
platform to field test the capabilities of the specifications and technologies.
We are also interested in developing common technologies that can not only
access and update the Veres One DID ledger, but other ledgers as well.</p>
