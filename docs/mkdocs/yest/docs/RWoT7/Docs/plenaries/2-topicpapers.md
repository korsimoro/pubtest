# Topic Papers

## Table 1: A Gestalt

The gestalt: Approachable and trustful technologies for ad hoc community building.

How can we make these identities more approachable and how can we help people to trust them?

How do we plug into existing government systems?

How do we build more lightweight ad hoc communities ourselves with some sort of legal standing?

## Table 2: DIDs & DADs

Some practical ideas for DIDs and key management.

Some expansion of DADs from last time.

## Table 3: Interoperability Conventions

Standard docs only get us to a certain level of interoperability. We need to use them in consistent ways across networks without having to rely on standards for everything.

How do we expand conventions into requirements like the GDPR

## Table 4: Digital Wallets

What are key attributes of wallets?
Key management, exchanging information, interoperability, data portability, does the province or state accept wallet.

Other questions:
Where does trust come from?
What are the big problems we need to solve?

## Table 5: Mental Models & Pitfalls

Five mental models for identities: security, liberty, data, relationships, capability. This creates problems within groups working on identity because they're talking at cross-purposes.

And discussion of common pitfalls (and catastrophes!), which often arise from not understanding that you're talking about different models, because identity is a multi-dimensional model. 

## Table 6: DID Technologies

Discussion of DID technologies, working on shared principles.


## Table 7: Digital Twinning

We give identity to machines.
There's an intersection with proof-of-personhood.

## Table 8: Petnames

Want human readable names for identities.

Demo of app that lets you introduce someone and suggest a name.

The missing aspect? CONTEXT.
Where we met someone, and in what context.

Instead of a top-down centralization, could have a bottom-up bubbling.
