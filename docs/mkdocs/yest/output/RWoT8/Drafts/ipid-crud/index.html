<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>IPID is an implementation of the DIDs specification over the IPFS (Interplanetary File System) network using the IPNS (Interplanetary Name Service) cryptographic namespace resolution service.</p>
<p>When you create your DID using IPNS, you create a key-pair - the Master Key - that is used to publish your DID-Document, where the hash of the public key becomes your did, like so: <code>&lt;did&gt;:ipid:&lt;base58(sha2(publicKey))&gt;</code>. The DID-Documents being published actually use IPLD to reference the previous version of the DID-Document, meaning you can traverse the IPLD DAG to retrieve the history of DID-Documents.</p>
<p>While simple, this technique has a few downsides that will be explained in this paper. Moreover, a few candidate solutions will be presented to solve these issues.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<h3 id="publishing-the-did-document-concurrently">Publishing the DID-Document concurrently</h3>
<p>In the real-world, you use different devices everyday, from your phone, to your laptop, to your smart-watch. It's likely that you may want perform changes to the DID-Document in any of these devices, such as revoking a public key.</p>
<p>Because IPFS is not a blockchain, you can't rely solely on it to order and timestamp actions made on the DID-Document. If two different devices try to perform changes to a IPID DID-Document concurrently, it's likely that one will overwrite the other one, which is far from ideal.</p>
<p>By leveraging Conflict-free Replicated Data-Types (CRDTs), each device will be able to independently and concurrently update and reconcile the DID-Document without coordination between them. A CRDT can be modelled in a variety of ways, but we will on Merkle-DAGs because IPLD already supports it natively. As a result, two Merkle-DAG based CRDT types will be presented as possible solutions: state-based and op-based.</p>
<h4 id="state-based-merkle-dag">State-based Merkle-DAG</h4>
<p>TODO:</p>
<h4 id="op-based-merkle-dag">OP-based Merkle-DAG</h4>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p>NOTE: Mention improvements on IPNS</p>
<h3 id="security-of-the-master-key">Security of the Master Key</h3>
<p>IPID DIDs are based on the hash of the Master Key, which is necessary to update the DID-Document. This means that the Master Key is in complete control of the DID-Document and can never be rotated. For these reasons, you should never list the Master Key it in the DID-Document to avoid having to ever rotate it. Moreover, it should be stored super securely. This is usually made in a non-friendly way, usually as a Paper Key.</p>
<p>But when you end up needing to manipulate the DID-Document, such as adding the public key of a new device or revoking the public key of another device, you need the Master-Key. But because it's stored safely, it's likely that you don't have it close to you, and you won't be able to finish what you trying to do.</p>
<h3 id="split-the-master-key-into-two-layers">Split the Master Key into two layers</h3>
<p>One possible solution would be to split the Master Key into two: Master Key Layer 1 (L1) and Master Key Layer 2 (Layer ). In this technique, the Master Key Layer 1 is used to publish a IPNS record that points to another IPNS record owned by the Master Key Layer 2, which in turn points to the DID-Document. This allows us to share the Master Key Layer 2 amongst devices, meaning each one them would be able to update the DID-Document. From a user-experience perspective, this is much better as you don't rely on using our Paper Key or other less pratical methods.</p>
<p>The Master Key Layer 1 must still be kept being super secure and would only be necessary whenever you need to revoke one of public keys of a device. Whenever that happens, a new Master Key Layer 2 (L2) is issued and the Master Key Layer 1 is used to update the IPNS record to point to that new key.</p>
<p>NOTE: Explore another keys
NOTE: Mention that you need your master key to keep republishing it</p>
