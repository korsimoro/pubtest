    <p>October 4, 2017<br>
Rebooting Web of Trust Workshop<br>
Cambridge, Mass</p>
<h1 id="notes-from-meeting-with-credibility-indicators-working-group">Notes from Meeting with Credibility Indicators Working Group</h1>
<p><strong>Guests:</strong> Ed Bice of Meedan and Sandro Hawke of W3C<br>
<strong>W3C Community Credentials Group leadership:</strong> Christopher Allen, Manu Sporny and Moses Ma<br>
<strong>Date/Time:</strong> October 4th, 12:30 to 3:30 pm</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p><em>These are top level findings, please feel free to annotate if you
attended this meeting.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ed provided some background about his history and the history of
    Meedan, which builds digital tools for global journalism
    and translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History of Meedan: https://meedan.com/en/about/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meedan has a solution called “Check” to enable confirmations and add
    meta-data https://meedan.com/check</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>
<p>Annotation standards and verifiable claims and credentials are the
    scaffolding of the solution to protecting how credibility indicators
    are expressed, and how various version of the ‘truth of a link,
    claim, or source’ is verified/contextualized and how these
    conclusions are expressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dispute reviews (Facebook) and fact checks (Google) are already
    being utilized by the platforms, this is an opening for our work to
    have scaled impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Essentially, we are proposing a new form of citation that is fully
    digitally enabled and applicable to the 21^st^ century</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the job of the Credibility Indicators Working Group to
    determine most useful indicators, building consensus from a the
    groups stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platforms, journalist’s standards bodies, and other stakeholders all
    need to participate in this process if it is going to succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our working group does hold one bias: While we seek to develop
    indicators that take human and machine generated signals,
    Journalists need to be critically empowered because this is a human
    problem, not an algorithmic problem at its heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fake news is a systemic problem, and we need to address the
    incentives for journalists, content creators, platforms, standards
    bodies, and consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This includes consideration of human and non-human distribution
    networks, Algorithms and AIs that might play a role in content
    creation and distribution, and the social/psychological aspects of
    taking in content corrections and correction distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating the best arguments/evidence against an article/claim is
    often more helpful than trying to prove the truth of the article or
    claim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Showing the work’ done in fact-checks and debunks is critical. As
    is ‘showing the context’ of the person and/or organization/media
    provider doing the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsive technologies include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bi-directional criticism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extrinsic criticism (a component of Xanadu)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fine grain criticism (Ibid)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>endorsement-based filtering (scripts that filter on certain
    credential criteria)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many technologies from the Credentials community can help, and
    emerging technologies, like selective disclosure and data
    minimization will help a LOT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to be aware of <a href="http://www.schema.org"><em>www.schema.org</em></a> -
    they have already implemented a first pass at ClaimReview - though
    by their own admission this should be extended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to investigate Equihash and Scrypt to combat bots and sibyl
    attacks through proof of work strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was some philosophical discussion around the use of the word
    “verification” as things are now considered to be partially true -
    the conclusion suggested by Ed was that we need a model that allows
    many parties to make assertions about the context/veracity/truth of
    a given claim/image/link/source. The meaning of the word ‘verified’
    then becomes a function of how effectively a given system user has
    deployed that word. And the measure of effectiveness is likely to be
    a combination of performance broadly defined and performance defined
    within a network (or other) filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychological perspective: Labeling a source as “Fake News” actually
    encourages its distribution by the recalcitrant, according to the
    research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facebook and other platform providers are in some cases more
    incentivized to care about engagement than combating fake news; but
    there is no question that their engineers, and perhaps even members
    of their management team, are very motivated to have FB serves
    broader social goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to unpack the psychological payoffs and motivations behind
    fake news problem – this requires more research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone is liking the idea of balancing Democrat and 1 Republican
    philanthropic funding sources to fund this project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total budget proposed is \$20 Million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first thing we need is a white paper, which Ed and Manu will
    write</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: what about education? Answer: look at what Michael
    Caufield is doing at WSU Vancouver around really nuanced digital
    literacy - much better than what FB is currently promoting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideas and Thoughts: let’s use videos to educate, need to embed
    financial incentives for fact checking – this might be possible via
    tokenization</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action Planning:</strong></p>
<p>The agreement going forward requires five bold first steps -</p>
<p>1) Moses and Ed will work on a Powerpoint presentation for funders, to
be ready in TWO WEEKS</p>
<p>2) Moses and Ed have a goal to raise a quick round of philanthropic
funding, from a balanced mix of liberal/conservative philanthropists, to
pay for initial work and get fast traction</p>
<p>3) Manu and Ed - as proxy for CIWG - will work a white paper with the
goal of merging CHECK from Meedan and VCs from CCG, to be completed
within ONE MONTH</p>
<p>4) Sandro will work on getting our proposal on a fast track with the W3C.</p>
<p>5) Get work done quickly so we can present to key stakeholders and
socialize at the W3C meeting in San Francisco in a month, with the goal
of achieving rapid traction</p>
