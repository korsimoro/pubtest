A review of the major ID2020 panels, as shown in Sue's graphic drawings (which should be available elsewhere in this Github)

*Important Themes*

Cool usage of self-sovereign identity term
Didn't limit identity to legal identity
Some discussion of gov't getting out of identity basis
- Gov't willing to follow if private sector leads

*Top Requirements*

1. If it doesn't work in the field, don't bother.
2. Talk with the people being affected, go into the field, don't just pontificate. (Don't be techno-colonialists.)
3. Pick a very specific use case, not just an abstraction.
4. Thanks about the possible good & bad outcomes, so we don't create new problems.
5. Don't endanger people with their IDs; don't further marganizalize people due to IDs.
6. We need an ID system that works from birth to death.
7. We need an ID system with 100 years of longevity (or the ability to roll-over).
