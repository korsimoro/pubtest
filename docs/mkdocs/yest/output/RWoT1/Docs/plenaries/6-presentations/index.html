    <ol>
<li>SMART SIGNATURES</li>
</ol>
<p>Can't use multisigs from multiple devices in most situations
Can't use sigs to defining changing rules over time for who can sign
Can't use sigs for very specific situations</p>
<p>Why can't we have more complex code that defines complex signature of these sorts?</p>
<p>Simplified version:</p>
<p>Pub key is a hash of a bit of code: the Validation Function</p>
<ol>
<li>REBRANDING THE WEB OF TRUST</li>
</ol>
<p>The term Web of Trust is murky, but clearly evocative</p>
<p>Web means decentralized, though that might be simplified
Trust means ... a system of entities and actions</p>
<p>Many names for other options</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>WATCHING FOR PEOPLE USING YOUR ID IN THE BLOCKCHAIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DPKI</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There's a mismatch between person with identifier and entity that controls the identifier</p>
<p>We want to create a system where person controls the identifier</p>
<p>Decentralized Personal Key-Value Stores</p>
<p>Blockchain a good tool for this.</p>
<p>But is it centralized? (Blockchain is very centralized in China right now)
So, need tools for Agnostic Blockchain Protocols, that allow use of any</p>
<p>And how do you run on a cellphone?
Thin clients</p>
<p>What if you lose control of an identifier?
Delegate control of key to a group</p>
<ol>
<li>CREATING A DISTRIBUTED REGISTRY OF PERMANENT IDENTIFIERS</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you rotate a root key across a cryptographic break?</p>
<p>Need some way to distribute permanent identifier that you can update in the future, that is resistant to attack.
These are not keys!</p>
<p>Goal: create a meta-protocol that allows the creation of a consistent view across network of what a token means</p>
<p>Decentralized Federated Identity?</p>
<ol>
<li>MAKING BETTER CAR-BUYING DECISIONS THROUGH SIGNAL AGGREGATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Web of Insight could allow the filtering of reputations</p>
<p>Use case: Carl is interested in buying a car.</p>
<p>Has some objective information about car, and has some subjective info from seller Sarah</p>
<p>Sybil focus at start concentrated on what is the pain in the system, but group decided to focus on
what behaviors the two people want.</p>
<p>Carl wants a drivable car, Sarah wants to sell and not to go to jail.</p>
<p>Ultimate Question:
WHO DOES CARL TURN TO FOR TRUSTED INFO?</p>
<p>The same report can mean different things to different people</p>
<p>Takeaway:
Every day, I'm faced with tough choices, sometimes need to rely upon others to understand
options and make decisions. Web systems that tell me about the attributes I care about
can help me make better decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li>OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY WEB OF TRUST: THE CONTROL AND LEVERAGE OF PERSONAL DATA</li>
</ol>
<p>Essential problem: Connecting technology to consumer need (or vice-versa)</p>
<p>A variety of real-world case studies:
- Selective Disclosure (age @ bar)
- Reputation Chains
- Bootstrapping a Partial ID Into More (create a bank account)
- Boostrapping from no documents or dangerous docs (refugee)
- Digital Detox (eject parts of identity linked to a violent actor)</p>
