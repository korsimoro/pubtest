1. SMART SIGNATURES

Can't use multisigs from multiple devices in most situations
Can't use sigs to defining changing rules over time for who can sign
Can't use sigs for very specific situations

Why can't we have more complex code that defines complex signature of these sorts?

Simplified version:

Pub key is a hash of a bit of code: the Validation Function

2. REBRANDING THE WEB OF TRUST

The term Web of Trust is murky, but clearly evocative

Web means decentralized, though that might be simplified
Trust means ... a system of entities and actions

Many names for other options

3. WATCHING FOR PEOPLE USING YOUR ID IN THE BLOCKCHAIN

4. DPKI

There's a mismatch between person with identifier and entity that controls the identifier

We want to create a system where person controls the identifier

Decentralized Personal Key-Value Stores

Blockchain a good tool for this.

But is it centralized? (Blockchain is very centralized in China right now)
So, need tools for Agnostic Blockchain Protocols, that allow use of any

And how do you run on a cellphone?
Thin clients

What if you lose control of an identifier?
Delegate control of key to a group

5. CREATING A DISTRIBUTED REGISTRY OF PERMANENT IDENTIFIERS

How do you rotate a root key across a cryptographic break?

Need some way to distribute permanent identifier that you can update in the future, that is resistant to attack.
These are not keys!

Goal: create a meta-protocol that allows the creation of a consistent view across network of what a token means

Decentralized Federated Identity?

6. MAKING BETTER CAR-BUYING DECISIONS THROUGH SIGNAL AGGREGATION

Web of Insight could allow the filtering of reputations

Use case: Carl is interested in buying a car.

Has some objective information about car, and has some subjective info from seller Sarah

Sybil focus at start concentrated on what is the pain in the system, but group decided to focus on
what behaviors the two people want.

Carl wants a drivable car, Sarah wants to sell and not to go to jail.

Ultimate Question:
WHO DOES CARL TURN TO FOR TRUSTED INFO?

The same report can mean different things to different people

Takeaway:
Every day, I'm faced with tough choices, sometimes need to rely upon others to understand
options and make decisions. Web systems that tell me about the attributes I care about
can help me make better decisions.

7. OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY WEB OF TRUST: THE CONTROL AND LEVERAGE OF PERSONAL DATA

Essential problem: Connecting technology to consumer need (or vice-versa)

A variety of real-world case studies:
- Selective Disclosure (age @ bar)
- Reputation Chains
- Bootstrapping a Partial ID Into More (create a bank account)
- Boostrapping from no documents or dangerous docs (refugee)
- Digital Detox (eject parts of identity linked to a violent actor)
