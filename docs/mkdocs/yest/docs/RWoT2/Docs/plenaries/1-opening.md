**Rebooting the Web of Trust II**

Welcome to the Facilitation Team

- Christopher Allen (host, facilitator)
- Sue Shay (graphic facilitator)
- Shannon Appelcline (scribe, editor)
- Kiara Robles (coordinator)

We want to create the next generation of decentralized web of trust.

We want to create 3-5 technical white papers or specifications that will have an impact.

**_Ground Rules_**

Our individual contributions are our own. Your topic papers are your own.

We are a collection of individuals, not representatives of our companies. We're just trying to work together to make the commons better.

Don't quote someone on social media without asking them first. (Writing about the event as a whole is fine.)

The results are more important than the process. If the process gets in the way, don't let it.
