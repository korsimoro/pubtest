    <p><em>General Thoughts</em></p>
<p>Water the plants that you want to grow.
(Instead of killing the ones that you don't like.)</p>
<p>Self-sovereign identity could catch on.
That's why Federated Identity was red-dotted yesterday.</p>
<p><em>Building Trust</em></p>
<p><em>Who's Our Target Audience?</em></p>
<p>Lots of people have good ideas, but we need something that's easy to use for the wider world.
We need to invent for them, not for ourselves.
Suggests top-down usability designs, not bottom-up technical designs
Technology and Application are different things.</p>
<p>We need one model with standardized words that are common place. This is one.</p>
<p><em>One Model</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Entity with IDENTITY</li>
<li>
<p>With IDENTIFIERS like names, IP addresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AUTHENTICATION suggests whether identifier is being used in an authorized way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objective ASSESSMENT can reveal attributes for identifier</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Web of Recognition might be more accurate than subjective Trust</p>
<ol>
<li>SYNTHESIS produces REPUTATION</li>
</ol>
<p>We often start from a position of mistrust to create trust.</p>
<ol>
<li>From SUPICION, we have TRUST</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I Am I</em></p>
<p>The base issue is that I am I, but we have to bootstrap that to the online world.</p>
<p>How do you prove that? By having a secret (such as a private key), and a token that represents that secret.</p>
<p>One meaning for Web of Trust: having the ability to control our corner of the internet world.
It's a Question of Power.</p>
<p>That's the problem with X.509: everyone but you has control over your identity
We need to give people <em>control</em> over their identity</p>
<p><em>But, things are also being created, becoming 'I's</em></p>
<p>We might need different systems for creating identity
Based on different ways that things created
A child might require auth from parents
A computer might be self-identified by producer</p>
<p><em>But we need to be able to separate identities too</em></p>
<p>A single strong identity is the antithesis of privacy
So that core binding has to be int he hands of the individuals</p>
<p>Universal global identifiers also have a lot of problems aside from privacy. 
Relations encoded into an identity system can create better identity.</p>
<p><em>More About Web of Trust</em></p>
<p>Web of Trust originated from PGP, where a web of friends can verify the authenticity of a key</p>
<p>Blockchain is different from this, because it has a different sort of Blockchain identifier.</p>
<p>But you could add a Web of Trust onto this.</p>
