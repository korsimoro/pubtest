# Introduction

This is the largest rebooting we've had, at 90 pre-signups and 69
topic papers.

We do introductions from everyone. We have many people from Europe,
Asia, and North America.

## What We're Doing and How to Do It

We are here to write: English writing, other language, or even code.

Some lessons we've learned:
* Seek first to understand, then to integrate. Try to understand
other peoples' weird ideas.  
* Use the white space: breaks, dinner. Meet people outside your group
and make new connections.
* When in doubt, write. Debate and have ideas, but flesh things out by
  putting words in.

## Why Rebooting?

PGP came out 27 years ago.

But it's old and it didn't meet a lot of the goals of the web of trust.

So Christopher Allen asked if we can reboot it.

At first Rebooting the Web of Trust, we said what we can do.

DIDs came out of RWOT, while Verifiable Claims really came to life.

This is the end of our fourth year, and we probably have another four
or five years for this to really take off.

## How to Be Excellent to Each Other

We are all very passionate, and must be careful not to cross a line.

We have a simple code of conduct: be excellent to each other, be
respectful, listen to each other, try to deescalate any situations.

You can alternatively approach: Andrew, Sam, or Manu if you're
uncomfortable about something.

We just want everyone to be resepected and feel heard.

Also, we want you to be crazy productive, so if you have any problems
with that, let us know.
