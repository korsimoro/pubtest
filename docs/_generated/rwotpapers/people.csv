I have training as an engineer from MIT and physician from Harvard Medical School. A career medical device entrepreneur, I founded AMICAS as the first Web-based radiology PACS and the first to provide imaging links in electronic health records as well as two other regulated medical diagnostics businesses. I participated in the founding of many healthcare interoperability initiatives including Blue Button, Direct Project, and Health Relationship Trust (HEART) and speaks frequently on privacy engineering in health care. My paper won a prize at ONC’s 2016 Blockchain Health competition. Our current project, HIE of One Trustee, uses public blockchains, standards, and open source software to enable patient-controlled independent health records that can last a lifetime. This reference implementation informs blockchain standards development for identity, credentials, and reputation with groups that include W3C, IEEE, Kantara, OpenID Foundation, and others.",,"https://github.com/agropper","https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloud.kumu.io/accounts/169502/111101/2ca0d80c-4857-46c4-b9d2-b1650dc70766.jpg","Adrian Gropper","https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-gropper-6916651/",,"https://twitter.com/agropper","Person"

To that end, I\"ve created more than a hundred designs for multi-currency systems, and my software company has built and deployed dozens of those systems. My current focus is launching Holochain, an alternative to blockchain for running fully P2P distributed applications. Initially, I put my degree in Artificial Intelligence to use at GM, Chrysler & Hughes, but soon realized I was committed to bringing intelligence to social architectures rather than to computers. I started student-run schools and award-winning, employee-run businesses and discovered that the self-managing feedback loops needed to operate these types of organizations were built on particular patterns of incentives and measurement. I began to unlock the social DNA by which groups operate and uncover the critical role of currencies as carriers of that social DNA.",,,,"Arthur Brock",,"https://medium.com/@artbrock","https://twitter.com/artbrock","Person"

Unfortunately, it can also be a waste of energy to develop extensive requirements specifications before starting work. Even worse, it is definitely a waste to rework and rework and rework because core requirements aren\"t being met. Even the best requirements need to change. The marketplace. Technology. People.
