<h3 id="by-snorre-lothar-von-gohren-edwin-snorrediwalaio-with-help-from-adrian-gropper-agropperhealthurlcom">by Snorre Lothar von Gohren Edwin snorre@diwala.io with help from Adrian Gropper agropper@healthurl.com</h3>
<p>For the community to get faster adoption of the standards we are working on, it is important to explore the the possibilities that can work out of the box, which is are safe enough to be trustworthy and not leak any sensitive data.</p>
<p>With Verifiable Credentials it is important to ask the question what are we expecting the issuer, the holder, and / or the verifier to do?</p>
<p>Sharing is what provides the end value for both the verifying and the holding party. If there is no sharing, the issuance of the VC has gone to waste. Hence if we are to provide value for the sharing party today, we have to ask the questions of where is this adopted, how can we make this adoption effortless? Can we put most of the work on the service providers? Is the user or another service expected to install software? If so, install software where? Is that software domain-specific or integrated with some existing software?</p>
<p>We have to explore methods of trustworthy sharing with all these aspects in mind and do it without too much intrusion on the verifier side? If so we can showcase the value of VC's in a real live scalable example, very quickly.</p>
<h1 id="situation">Situation</h1>
<p>During their users tests and pilots in East Africa, Diwala experienced that the approach for sharing done by identity applications in the decentralized community is not always feasible in an East African situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of the current sharing suggestions are based on software that has to be installed at every point of the process, from verifier, issuer and user. </li>
<li>That the process is more pull based rather than push based. In this case it is expected of the verifier to have some sort of software installed to be able to pull the information from the sharing party, and not that the initial interaction can start from the sharing party, in one way or another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early during the user tests it was agreed that the issuing party needed some kind of software, because they lacked any type of digital and efficient solution to be able to issue verifications to their students. They instantly saw the value a simple software could provide in the long run, and the value gained regarding efficiency and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>During tests for the receiving party it soon became clear that an identity application/wallet, such as uPort or Jolocom, could not provide enough services and information around skill verifications and other metadata issued to the subject. So it was concluded that the subject needed an app to be able better to understand and make sense of the data/VCs issued. It was also concluded that the current sharing solution in the testd identity application/wallet, was not sufficient to give instant value. The extra app had to take care of the sharing based on the data that was available from the identity application/wallet. Yet another software installation.</p>
<p>For the last party, the verifying party, we concluded that they could not be dependent on having a software installed if this was going to scale in any way. The only way to solve this was to depend on open web technologies to be able to create a simple site that the verifier could load independently. </p>
<p>In East Africa, Uganda to be specific, we found that even installing a couple of apps on a phone was problematic without enough incentive or clarity of what value this would provide the user. That was mainly because of the lack of space on the phone. 
We also saw that the systems used, are not always as integrated as the western culture is used to, meaning it is quite difficult to figure out where in the pipeline a possible software installation would happen to generate the most value.</p>
<h1 id="a-solution-in-experimentation">A solution in experimentation</h1>
<p>What Diwala tries to do is to provide value for the sharing of VCs, given the current technological situation right now. Trying to figure out how to test out the value of VCs with the least possible friction. Diwala has taken the approach to sharing through simple URLs and JWTs. This part still needs a lot of work, but that is why I am raising the question for the community, to work together to build something that is as frictionless as possible, to be able to generate value here and now.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Diwala works with uPort as an implementation for the identity solution, signing and initial issuance to the receivers of the VCs. Diwala builds a lightweight certification solution for schools and course holders, that tries to remove the friction of decentralized identity onboarding, help creating VCs for skills and providing a view for the received VCs. This is done with a simple online web administration user interface for the issuing organization. </p>
<p>The receiver has two apps, the uPort app for their identity, and the Diwala app for their view and sharing possibilities of the received VCs. Which we call their skill-identity. As mentioned earlier, uPort did not provide enough contextual services for these skill VCs, therefore this second app was created. </p>
<p>The app allows for sharing through a simple URL, with the standard functionality for sharing on a phone. The VC, which is a JWT, coming from the uPort app/”your wallet” is appended to the URL that is being shared. This URL points to a service currently hosted by Diwala, which starts a verification process of the provided VC or VCs. This service verifies the signatures through a did resolver, loads any data that might be provided through the service URLs of the DIDs, and tries to showcase this to the verifier in a way that is trustworthy. This is all done without any communication to the Diwala database, which means this can be converted to a standalone SDK(Software development kit) provided to other services.</p>
<h2 id="questions-concering-this-solution">Questions concering this solution</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do can you confirm the VC is coming from the person that sent it?</li>
<li>How can the verifier trust the validity of the data and that the signatures are actually verified decentralized?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>There are things to discuss and there might not be that the mentioned solution is viable at all. But it is something Diwala saw as a possibility and are currently testing out the value gain of this approach.</p>
<p>But in the end, the discussion is about adoption, how can we introduce this as frictionless as possible, and still keep the core values intact.</p>
<h3 id="there-are-a-few-problem-areas-to-tackle-when-sharing">There are a few problem areas to tackle when sharing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Replay attacks 
This can be mitigated with for example uPort’s challenge/response protocol, but then software is needed on all sides. If that protocol is not used, then you would need a an out-of-band method, e.g., ID card, that associates the VC with the individual</li>
<li>Trust that it is coming from the person that shared it.
This is also mitigated with the same protocol mentioned above, but with bigger intrusion than needed. But again all this comes down to that the signatures are coming from the person who say they are sharing. And that  the sharing party owns the keys signed, are they on the users device?</li>
<li>How much software needs to be installed?</li>
<li>Who holds the software?</li>
</ul>
