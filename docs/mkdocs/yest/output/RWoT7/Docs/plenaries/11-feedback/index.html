    <h1 id="feedback">Feedback</h1>
<h2 id="pre-events">Pre-Events</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have more information about what to expect,
including a schedule, on the web site.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a call that everyone interested could join
in.</p>
<p>It'd be nice to be able to decide on papers beforehand and to have
more institutional ways of continuing them afterward. [The topic
papers are that, kind of.]</p>
<p>The papers can be intimidating, especially since knowledge level isn't
realy set beforehand. Maybe we should categorize them based on their
level of technical detail or a short description of who would be
interested or just a #TAG.</p>
<p>Some UI or UX improvements to paper listings can help.</p>
<p>Would like to see a curation or editorial committee that can go back
through topic papers and grab the important ones.</p>
<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
<p>Why don't we do voting and such online to make it faster? Why do we
limit topics to the postits.</p>
<p>Would have loved some talk from experts about their own fields.</p>
<p>Three Horizons was cool, but rushed.</p>
<p>Enjoyed more mixing in previous RWOTs. Prevented knowing about more
papers. Maybe Lightning Talks of a minute for each?</p>
<p>Good physical space, but Mississauga was so big that everyone was a
million miles apart.</p>
<p>Normal time of this worked better. (Theoretically ending at 5pm.)</p>
<h2 id="post-events">Post-Events</h2>
<p>Probably post event: getting in touch with everyone. 
Generally, channels have been a challenge.</p>
<p>Slack has never been sufficient.
But we need promote it better.</p>
<p>Is there a way for people not here to help with the papers?</p>
<p>Where have these papers been used elsewhere?
(Lots of places!)</p>
<p>Should have a license statement that says how to reference the paper.
(Just a citation.)
(Also need to access the papers through short URLs, maybe through
weboftrust.info or an IPFS hash.)</p>
<h2 id="impact-how-to-take-this-outside">Impact: How to Take This Outside</h2>
<p>W3C</p>
<p>Going to ask for feedback from companies that may use DID or may join
W3C to help push this stuff forward</p>
<p>Ask Me About DID Buttons?</p>
<p>What about IETF, ISO, ISH, or other standard bodies?
   * ISO is doing some interesting work in identity &amp; privacy (SC27 Working Group 5)
   * ISO: TC307
   * IETF has lots of places where DIDs would be useful because they use identifiers (DINRG)</p>
<p>There is opportunity for serious federal funding, if people know how
to do it. This is for standards that support the economy of the US
(and the Dept. of Commerce).</p>
<p>Want a roadmap for how Web of Trust interacts with standards groups.</p>
<p>But ultimately we don't know what to do with some of our papers!</p>
<p>Authors can take it on, on their own.</p>
<p>Maybe M's company could produce a light-weight journal of some
existing papers with light peer review.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-rebooting">The Next Rebooting</h2>
<p>Requests for overseas: Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Africa</p>
<p>These were the interest levels of people who said they'd definitely
attend:</p>
<p>Taiwan: 22
South Africa: 19
Europe: 35
North America: 28</p>
<p>Most likely time: first week of March or a week later. (RSA is March
4-8, so avoid that.) Or even last week of February.</p>
<p>Further future: if the next one is overseas, maybe Vancouver in second
week of September for the one after.</p>
<p>Possibilities for Spring 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amsterdam: Dutch blockchain</li>
<li>Utah: Self-sovereign ID conference in 2019 from Silicon Slopes</li>
<li>Los Angeles</li>
</ul>
