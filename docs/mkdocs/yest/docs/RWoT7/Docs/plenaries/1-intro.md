# Intro Plenary

## What We're Doing

This is about publishing papers.

We are changing the world by publishing papers!

We're hoping for 5-8 papers.

## Our History

We have largely lost a classic way of looking at identity, while the dangers have gotten worse, in the form of government spying, of stateless people.

We don't want to solve these problems in the centralized ways of the past. So we're looking at blockchain and other new technologies.

In the years since we've started, we've successfully moved some of our work to the W3C.

## The Process

We have a process.

But don't let it get in the way of our goal.

_Papers._

We don't want great people twiddling their thumbs, as happens at many conferences.

### Rules

But we have some hard and fast rules:

Papers need to be done by at least _two_ different people, preferably from two different companies.

We have to get a first draft by end of week, with abstract and defined lead.

### Code of Conduct

Simple: Don't be jerks.

Try to listen, not just speak.

Focus on _collaborating_.

The point is to let us have a productive and enjoyable three days, where no one feels _shut down_.
