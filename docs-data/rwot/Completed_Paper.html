            <td align="left">On November 3rd and 4th, the Rebuilding the Web of Trust design workshop looked at the future of decentralized trust on the internet with the goal of producing 3-5 white papers and specs. Those papers were polished for release in December, leaving the question: what's next? Our major goal is to produce something notable for the 25th anniversary of PGP, in July 2016. This should be a working proof-of-concept that can help the Web of Trust to reach a broader audience. It should be something that's both usable and used and it needs to be compelling. If we can meet this goal, we can make our design ideas into reality</td>

            <td align="left">Today’s Internet places control of online identities into the hands of third-parties. Email addresses, usernames, and website domains are borrowed or &quot;rented&quot; through DNS, X.509, and social networks. This results in severe usability and security challenges Internet-wide. This paper describes a possible alternate approach called decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI), which returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to. By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates. In usage, it can help “Johnny” to finally encrypt thanks to its relegation of public key management to secure decentralized datastores. Finally, it includes mechanisms to recover lost or compromised identifiers.</td>

            <td align="left">In November 2015 Facebook's share price broke $100 USD/share, for a total valuation of $290 billion USD. This is evidence that both Facebook and the market understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. However, the now-conventional absorb-everything design of Facebook is a blunt one. Employing users as passive producers with no control of their own data only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of information and identity. Some of these constraints arise from Facebook's centralization, something that tends to worsen as an organization grows in size. There are limits to the amount of trust this sort of centralized authority can garner. This often results in punitive postures: democracies come with the expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government; while corporations are watched over by regulatory bureaus and further deterred by class-action suits.  Decentralized systems that are engineered to prevent concentrating power as they grow avoid this. They can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide their assessments as input. Protocols and structures that are distributed and self-sovereign also offer significantly improved robustness, portability, and versatility than conventional centralized or escrowed processes — especially when combined with secure cryptography.</td>

            <td align="left">The Web of Trust. It’s the buzzword for a new model of decentralized identity. However, it’s also a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years and has been heavily overloaded with meaning during that time. The classic definition of Web of Trust derives from PGP, but the top Google results refer to a website reputation rating system created by a Finnish internet company. Meanwhile, some use it as a big tent that includes identity authentication &amp; verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the classic concept. To build a contemporary Web of Trust, we need to better define it. To do so, we must both understand what the classic Web of Trust was and create a model for the elements of trust that are contained within a more modern definition.</td>

            <td align="left">Traditional cryptographic signature systems are based on strictly-defined authentication and authorization mechanisms that assume a single private key can be used to produce a given signature and that a single public key can be used to verify it. Given the evident limitations of this design, we propose an alternative with more powerful capabities, based on the ability to explicitly outline and fully program conditions for verification. These conditions would then be used to determine when a signature or set of signatures can be considered valid. Our inspiration for this authorization system is the bitcoin scripting language, where the authorization to spend funds is explicitly defined within a script, rather than being implicitly defined through the reference to an authorized public key. The largest benefit of explicit specification of authorization conditions is that the system is fully extensible, so new operations can be defined at any time, with the only limitation being the set of operations that the authorization interpreters understand. </td>

            <td align="left">The term “identity” is a challenge. Both laypeople and experts struggle to communicate clearly about it. The term has numerous rich and useful meanings. That same flexibility and expressivity also makes it easy to misunderstand subtle nuances and often leads to ideological debate rather than understanding and applications. We compensate with adjectives, creating new phrases like “digital identity” or “legal identity”, but we often still speak past each other. We regularly refer to “identities” as things that are assigned to us or that we own, things we control or present, instead of using more rigorous terms such as “identifiers” or “credentials”. This fluidity often confuses because, at its core, identity is an emergent phenomenon that doesn’t have an existence independent of the observer.  We propose using “correlation” instead of “identity” when discussing concrete identities in identity systems. It isn’t a word-for-word replacement, but using it will improve the conversation. We argue that “correlation” provides a more concise and clear understanding of how identity is created and applied in both digital and real-world systems, and that using it as an alternative to “identity” will improve communication and understanding.</td>

            <td align="left">Together, physicians and patients steer treatment and are responsible for the vast majority of decisions, and therefore expenditures, in healthcare. Yet the technology that mediates the physician-patient relationship today is not directly purchased or controlled by either the physicians or the patients. Electronic health records and health information exchange technology are sold as strategic assets to institutions — typically very large businesses, that currently have incentives to maximize institutional growth. We seek a better balance of institutional needs with the needs of physicians and patients. This may also solve problems of costs. It is widely accepted that reducing healthcare cost growth requires genuine practice reform. Few institutions, however, are planning to reduce their own size. By focusing health information technology and interoperability on the physician-patient relationship we bypass the inertia of institutions, fertilize the environment for value-based payment, and optimize care options among hospitals, the community, and home, as appropriate.</td>

They’re the heart of SSH, the foundation of certificates, and the core of newer technologies like blockchain.  However, today’s simplistic signatures are just the start; they can be improved, to create more powerful and more complex signatures that can truly be better and smarter.

DIDs resolve to DDOs (DID descriptor objects)—simple JSON documents that contain all the metadata needed to prove ownership and control of a DID. Specifically, a DDO contains a set of key descriptions, which are machine-readable descriptions of the identity owner’s public keys, and a set of service endpoints, which are resource pointers necessary to initiate trusted interactions with the identity owner. Each DID uses a specific DID method, defined in a separate DID method specification, to define how the DID is registered, resolved, updated, and revoked on a specific distributed ledger or network.</td>

            <td align="left">Much of what we know as a species has accreted through experience. We’ve seen things work and fail, and we’ve reacted: we've created checks and balances, institutions and procedures, making calculated tradeoffs for the net benefit of individuals and communities. This wisdom is embodied in laws, social norms, patterns, proverbs, and traditions.  The digital landscape, with its turbulent pace and its jockeying technologies, is a new dimension of shared experience. Identity is a central aspect of that new dimension. Who we are, how we interact, how we give and receive value, and how we hold one another accountable are all integral to identity — and they are every bit as important to the digital landscape as they were in pre-digital times. Software and hardware are more malleable than human nature. Building the code and machines that run a social network can be done in months or years, and mostly by those writing the code — but changes in the nature of friendship, trust, family, employment, and other human relationships are evolutionary, incremental, and undirected, and they unfold over generations and centuries more often than months. This mismatch in evolution matters; we risk rushing into digital construction, and not pausing to consult moral calipers or experiential plumb lines. Widespread surveillance, doxing, online bullying, and the existance of child pornography are all evidence that our digital universe has the same opportunities and pitfalls familiar in other contexts.</td>

Third parties must now obtain explicit and documented consent from people (data subjects) to collect, process, store or disclose their personal data. A specification for operationalising these regulatory requirements, using digital Consent Receipts, is being developed through the Consent and Information-Sharing Working Group of the Kantara Initiative. In a parallel effort, COALA-IP has developed a blockchain-ready, community-driven generic protocol for intellectual property licensing that applies the Linked Content Coalition (LCC) framework to &quot;unify digital rights data management&quot;.

            <td align="left">Reputation systems provide an effective way to build a web of trust on the Internet. They consider the history of interactions between peers to establish a measure for a reputation that can itself be used to support a trust decision. Decentralised reputations systems (DRS) rely on a decentralised computer architecture and a distributed ledger to store and maintain reputation information, so that no single entity has control over that information. While there have been numerous analyses of how reputation may be used, there has to date been no systematic definition of the various aspects that should be considered when a reputation system is being designed. By defining these design considerations, we can come to a consensus about what is and is not important in a system. We can discuss the different ways in which they can be built and we can conduct further research and analysis into specific factors in a structured way.</td>

            <td align="left">The goal of the &quot;LD Signature Format Alignment&quot; Working Group at Rebooting the Web of Trust IV was to investigate the feasibility and impact of the proposed 2017 RSA Signature Suite spec, which brings JSON-LD signatures into alignment with the JOSE JSON Web Signature (JWS) standards. The 2017 RSA Signature Suite is based on RFC 7797, the JSON Web Signature (JWS) Unencoded Payload Option specification. This approach avoids past concerns about JWT raised in the LD signature adopters, including: Increased space consumption associated with base-64 encoding. Difficulty of nesting or chaining signatures, leading to data duplication. Use of a format that is not a JSON object, preventing ability to rely exclusively on a JSON document-based storage engine (while preserving the signature). Using unencoded payloads with detached content, as described in the introduction of RFC 7797, addresses these concerns and helps in cases in which &quot;...the payload may be very large and where means are already in place to enable the payload to be communicated between the parties without modifications.&quot; This avoids unnecessary copying and transformations which can result &quot;significant space and time improvements&quot; when working with large payloads.</td>

Users can use implementations of ActivityPub like Mastodon and MediaGoblin as libre alternatives to large siloed social networking systems such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. In general ActivityPub follows the client-server paradigm that has been popular on the World Wide Web, while restoring some level of decentralization. Current implementations of ActivityPub go as far as to bring a level of decentralization akin to email,2 but there are many opportunities to go further. By attaching public keys to the profiles of actors (users) on the network and using Linked Data Signatures, we can add a web of trust to the federated social web and use it to enhance user privacy and to assert the integrity of messages sent over the network. By using a decentralized identifier system such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) we can move fully from a decentralized to a distributed system,3 by escaping the core centralization mechanisms of DNS and SSL certificate authorities.</td>

The current approach has both security and scalability issues. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint. This avoids creating confused-deputy security issues and expands scale by enabling the hub to delegate access to resources not stored in the hub itself.</td>

            <td align="left">Decentralized Autonomic Data (DAD)</td>
            <td align="left">This paper proposes a new class of data called decentralized autonomic data (DAD). The term decentralized means that the governance of the data may not reside with a single party. A related concept is that the trust in the data provenance is diffuse in nature. Central to the approach is leveraging the emerging DID (decentralized identifier) standard. The term autonomic means self-managing or self-regulating. In the context of data, we crystalize the meaning of self-managing to include cryptographic techniques for maintaining data provenance that make the data self-identifying, self-certifying, and self-securing. Implied thereby is the use of cryptographic keys and signatures to provide a root of trust for data integrity and to maintain that trust over transformation of that data, e.g. provenance. Thus key management must be a first order property of DADs. This includes key reproduction, rotation, and recovery. The pre-rotation and hybrid recovery methods presented herein are somewhat novel. The motivating use of DAD is to provide provenance for streaming data that is generated and processed in a distributed manner with decentralized governance. Streaming data are typically measurements that are collected and aggregated to form higher level constructs. Applications include analytics and instrumentation of distributed web or internet of things (IoT) applications. Of particular interest is the use of DADs in self-sovereign reputation systems. A DAD seeks to maintain a provenance chain for data undergoing various processing stages that follows diffuse trust security principles including signed at rest and in motion. Streaming data applications may impose significant performance demands on the processing of the associated data. Consequently one major goal is to use efficient mechanisms for providing the autonomic properties. This means finding minimally sufficient means for managing keys and cryptographic integrity. Importantly this paper provides detailed descriptions of the minimally sufficient means for key reproduction, rotation, and recovery for DID leveraged DADS.</td>

This means demonstrating control of the DID using the mechanism specified in the DID Document's &quot;authentication&quot; object. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels and to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, Verifiable Credentials, and Capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and are out of scope for this document. This paper gives on overview of the scope of DID Auth, supported protocols and flows, and the use of components of the DID Documents that are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges and responses.</td>

            <td align="left">One of the major problems with bootstrapping self-sovereign identity is that it requires adoption by a large number of people. Pushing self-sovereign identity from the top-down is most likely to result in a technology that’s not actually used, but instead encouraging the average person to demand self-sovereign identity from the bottom-up will result in the organic development of a vibrant, well-utilized decentralized web-of-trust ecosystem. This paper addresses that need by offering arguments to a variety of people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity, uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of centralization. By focusing on the needs of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfill their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality.</td>

            <td align="left">Authenticity is a challenge for any identity solution. In the physical world, at least in America, it is not difficult to change one's identity. In the digital world, there is the problem of bots. The botnet detection market is expected to be worth over one billion USD by 2023, in a landscape where most digital activity is still heavily centralized. These centralized digital solutions have the advantage of being able to track IP addresses, request phone verification, and present CAPTCHAs to users in order to authenticate them. If this problem is so difficult to solve in the centralized world, how much more challenging will it be in the decentralized world, where none of these techniques are available? In this paper, we explore the idea of using a web of trust as a tool to add authenticity to decentralized identifiers (DIDs). We define a framework for deriving relative trust degrees using a given trust metric: a &quot;trustworthiness&quot; score for a given identity from the perspective of another identity. It is our intent that this framework may be used as a starting point for an ongoing exploration of graph-based, decentralized trust. We believe this approach may ultimately be used as a foundation for decentralized reputation.</td>

            <td align="left">Currently, the Web provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for the dissemination of information via links. Unfortunately, there is no generalized mechanism that enables verifying that a fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation. Would it be possible to create an extensible and multipurpose cryptographic link that provides discoverability, integrity, and scheme agility? This paper proposes a linking solution that decouples integrity information from link and resource syntaxes, enabling verification of any representation of a resource from any type of link. We call this approach Resource Integrity Proofs (RIPs). RIPs provide a succinct way to link to resources with cryptographically verifiable content integrity. RIPs can be combined with blockchain technology to create discoverable proofs of existence to off-chain resources.</td>
