# LD Signature Alignment Problem Statement


## Definition

Investigate viability of aligning LD signatures with JWS through the proposed Verifiable Claims Profile approach.

Ensure approach is suitable for existing scenarios
- DID Auth
- Blockchain-based proofs


## Scope

In scope:
- Signature format
- Mapping/alignment for (at minimum) above scenarios
- Flexible merkle proof placeholder, i.e. placeholder for existing proof formats e.g. Chainpoint/Open Timestamps

NOT in scope:
- Specification of merkle proof structure (e.g. Chainpoint 3.0, Open Timestamps, etc)
- Not suggesting to use incorporate Koblitz signatures into broader standards 
	- Note: it's probably useful to describe this in detail, i.e. where they can be used and where they should not


## Goal for Friday PM

- Signature suite specification
- Implementation / prototypes
	- Blockcerts
	- LD signatures (playground)
- Writeup

OR...if problems encountered

- Detailed write up of issues
