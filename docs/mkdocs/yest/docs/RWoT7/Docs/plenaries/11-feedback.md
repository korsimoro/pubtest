# Feedback

## Pre-Events

It would be nice to have more information about what to expect,
including a schedule, on the web site.

It would be nice to have a call that everyone interested could join
in.

It'd be nice to be able to decide on papers beforehand and to have
more institutional ways of continuing them afterward. [The topic
papers are that, kind of.]

The papers can be intimidating, especially since knowledge level isn't
realy set beforehand. Maybe we should categorize them based on their
level of technical detail or a short description of who would be
interested or just a #TAG.

Some UI or UX improvements to paper listings can help.

Would like to see a curation or editorial committee that can go back
through topic papers and grab the important ones.

## Events

Why don't we do voting and such online to make it faster? Why do we
limit topics to the postits.

Would have loved some talk from experts about their own fields.

Three Horizons was cool, but rushed.

Enjoyed more mixing in previous RWOTs. Prevented knowing about more
papers. Maybe Lightning Talks of a minute for each?

Good physical space, but Mississauga was so big that everyone was a
million miles apart.

Normal time of this worked better. (Theoretically ending at 5pm.)

## Post-Events

Probably post event: getting in touch with everyone. 
Generally, channels have been a challenge.

Slack has never been sufficient.
But we need promote it better.

Is there a way for people not here to help with the papers?

Where have these papers been used elsewhere?
(Lots of places!)

Should have a license statement that says how to reference the paper.
(Just a citation.)
(Also need to access the papers through short URLs, maybe through
weboftrust.info or an IPFS hash.)

## Impact: How to Take This Outside

W3C

Going to ask for feedback from companies that may use DID or may join
W3C to help push this stuff forward

Ask Me About DID Buttons?

What about IETF, ISO, ISH, or other standard bodies?
   * ISO is doing some interesting work in identity & privacy (SC27 Working Group 5)
   * ISO: TC307
   * IETF has lots of places where DIDs would be useful because they use identifiers (DINRG)
  
There is opportunity for serious federal funding, if people know how
to do it. This is for standards that support the economy of the US
(and the Dept. of Commerce).

Want a roadmap for how Web of Trust interacts with standards groups.

But ultimately we don't know what to do with some of our papers!

Authors can take it on, on their own.

Maybe M's company could produce a light-weight journal of some
existing papers with light peer review.

## The Next Rebooting

Requests for overseas: Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Africa

These were the interest levels of people who said they'd definitely
attend:

Taiwan: 22
South Africa: 19
Europe: 35
North America: 28

Most likely time: first week of March or a week later. (RSA is March
4-8, so avoid that.) Or even last week of February.

Further future: if the next one is overseas, maybe Vancouver in second
week of September for the one after.

Possibilities for Spring 2020:

   * Amsterdam: Dutch blockchain
   * Utah: Self-sovereign ID conference in 2019 from Silicon Slopes
   * Los Angeles
