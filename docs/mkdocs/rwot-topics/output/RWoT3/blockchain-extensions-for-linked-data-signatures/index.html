    <h1 id="blockchain-extensions-for-linked-data-signatures">Blockchain Extensions for Linked Data Signatures</h1>
<p><strong><em>by Manu Sporny, Harlan Wood, Noah Thorp, Wayne Vaughn, Christopher Allen, Jason Bukowski, and Dave Longley</em></strong></p>
<p><em>A White Paper from Rebooting the Web of Trust III</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a>
is used to describe a recommended best practice for exposing, sharing, and
connecting information on the Web using standards, such as URLs, to identify
things and their properties. When information is presented as Linked Data,
other related information can be easily discovered and new information can be
easily linked to it. Linked Data is extensible in a decentralized way, greatly
reducing barriers to large scale integration.</p>
<p>With the increase in usage of Linked Data for a variety of applications, there
is a need to be able to verify the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data
documents. The <a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/ld-signatures/">Linked Data Signatures specification</a> added authentication and integrity protection to linked data documents through the use of public/private key cryptography without sacrificing Linked Data features such as extensibility and composability.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been interest in extending Linked Data Signatures to
support new use cases surfaced in the Blockchain and Verifiable Claims
ecosystems. These use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin-style <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf">secp256k1</a> signatures</li>
<li><a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/pop2016/">Proof of Publication</a>,
   <a href="http://www.chainpoint.org/">Chainpoint</a>, and other Blockchain anchoring
   use cases</li>
<li>Pure JSON normalization and clear-text signing algorithms</li>
<li>JOSE JSON Web Token-style signatures</li>
</ul>
<p>This whitepaper explores various extensions to the Linked Data Signatures
specification that are designed to support the use cases listed above.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-secp256k1">Support for secp256k1</h2>
<p>Support for Bitcoin-style secp256k1 signatures would result in a signature
block that looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>"signature": {
  "type": "sha256-ecdsa-secp256k1-2016",
  "created": "2016-09-22T22:38:03Z",
  "creator": "bitcoin-address:1LGpGhGK8...rP4xWER",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "nonce": "ba9e0b95",
  "signatureValue": "IKwTJ...E37UsLgs="
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This signature would require the creation of a new
<a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/lds2016/">Linked Data Signature Suite</a>
specification defining the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>canonicalizationAlgorithm - https://w3id.org/security#URDNA2015 defined in
   [RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]</li>
<li>digestAlgorithm - https://w3id.org/security#sha256 defined in
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234">RFC6234</a></li>
<li>signatureAlgorithm - http://w3id.org/security#secp256k1 defined in
   <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf">SEC2v2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few open questions that need to be discussed at Rebooting
Web of Trust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the nonce necessary or optional?</li>
<li>Are developers aware that the Universale RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm
   is executed when performing the digital signature?</li>
<li>Are developers comfortable with using a JSON-LD context with their data? Are
   they aware that information that doesn't map is dropped? Should the JSON-LD
   processors fail when information is dropped from signed data?</li>
<li>Is a Signature Suite named <code>sha256-ecdsa-secp256k1-2016</code> easy for developers
   to remember?</li>
<li>Should the creator field (example: <code>bitcoin-address:1LGpGhGK8whX23ZNdxrgtjKrek9rP4xWER</code>)
   be dereferenceable outside of the Bitcoin Blockchain?</li>
<li>Is the Security Vocabulary the best place to put the secp256k1 signature
   algorithm term?</li>
<li>The pubkey is embedded with the signature — since the pubkey for
   ECDSA sig is the same as for a schnorr sig, should we explicitly separate
   them? Otherwise you have to understand how to parse composite signature
   format (I think it is a byte plus pubkey plus sig) if you wish to
   correlate any public keys.</li>
<li>If we separate out the pubkey from signature, how will that work
   with multisig? With smart signatures?</li>
<li>There is no standard for sharing bitcoin pub keys — it has been suggested,
   but never implemented that it should be a base58 prefix of 4,but in fact,
   most Bitcoin ASCII armored signatures use base64.</li>
<li>Another issue is that base58 is unique to Bitcoin, and there are no
   international standards for it.</li>
<li>What schema.org info do we need to define (applies to chainpoint as well).</li>
<li>Should the creator really be the pub key hash, or the pub key, or point
   to a verified claim or DID? If to the later, what field can the pubkey be
   put in?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="support-for-camlys">Support for CamLys</h2>
<p>Support for Camenisch-Lysyanskaya style signatures would result in a signature
block that looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/anoncreds/v1",
  "homeState": "Virginia",
  "signature": {
    "type": "CamLys2016",
    "created": "2016-09-22T22:38:03Z",
    "creator": "https://blue.example.com/keys/1",
    "claimDefinition": "https://blue.example.com/definitions/drivers-license",
    "revocationTails": "https://blue.example.com/tails/set-32893",
    "revocationTailsHash": "urn:sha256:43903bab3b4b2b3b4b4b2bb2b8384ad457",
    "accumulator": "https://blue.example.com/accumulator/set-32893",
    "domain": "example.com",
    "signatureValue": "IKwTJ...E37UsLgs="
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This signature would require the creation of a new
<a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/lds2016/">Linked Data Signature Suite</a>
specification defining the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>canonicalizationAlgorithm - https://w3id.org/security#NCA (no
   canonicalization algoirthm)</li>
<li>digestAlgorithm - https://w3id.org/security#sha256 defined in
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234">RFC6234</a></li>
<li>signatureAlgorithm - http://w3id.org/security#camlys defined in
   <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/lysyanskaya/cl02b.pdf">CAMLYS</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blockchain-anchoring">Blockchain Anchoring</h2>
<p>Blockchain anchoring techniques are used to prove that data existed at a
specific point in time. These techniques cryptographically embed data in a
blockchain by publishing a hash of the data in a blockchain transaction. By
comparing the hash embedded in a blockchain with the hash of a set of data,
it’s possible to verify that the data existed at a specific time.</p>
<p>Merkle trees are often used to store and hash the data, enabling large volumes
of data to be stored into blockchains like the Bitcoin blockchain. These
mechanisms, such as <a href="http://www.chainpoint.org/">Chainpoint</a> and
<a href="https://petertodd.org//2016/opentimestamps-announcement">OpenTimestamps</a>,
are currently in
the experimental standardization phase. It is possible to merge approaches like
Chainpoint with Linked Data Signatures. The Linked Data Signatures
<a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/pop2016/">Proof of Publication</a>
specification is one such approach, where the blockchain receipt may be
embedded in the Linked Data Signature without any modification to
the <a href="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/lds2016/">LinkedDataSignature2016</a>
signature suite.</p>
<p>Included is an example of a Proof of Publication style Linked Data signature:</p>
<pre><code>"signature": {
    "type": "LinkedDataSignature2015",
    "creator": "http://example.com/i/pat/keys/5",
    "created": "2011-09-23T20:21:34Z",
    "domain": "example.org",
    "nonce": "2bbgh3dgjg2302d-d2b3gi423d42",
    "merklePublicationProof": {
      "@context": "https://w3id.org/chainpoint/v2",
      "type": "ChainpointSHA256v2",
      "targetHash": "bdf8c9b...cb8e85ef2",
      "merkleRoot": "51296f46...6581a7a",
      "proof": [
        { "left": "bdf8c9b...e85ef2" },
        { "left": "cb0dbbed...2e49faf" },
        { "right": "cb0dbb...2e49faf" }
      ],
      "anchors": [{
        "type": "BTCOpReturn",
        "sourceId": "f3be82...fadee"
      }]
    },
    "signatureValue": "OGQzNGVkMz...ODIyOWM32NjI="
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are a few open questions that need to be discussed at Rebooting Web
of Trust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there interest in supporting proof of publication in the signature block,
   or are unsigned blockchain receipts good enough because the proof exists
   in the blockchain itself?</li>
<li>Should blockchain receipts have digital signatures, or are digital
   signatures on blockchain receipts redundant?</li>
<li>Is there interest in integrating Chainpoint 2.0 style receipts into the
   signature block for Linked Data Signatures?</li>
<li>Do we need to more explicit the separation the data format for the message
   vs how the merkle root is stored? Like DIDs, there will be multiple methods
   for storing the merkle root — but the data format once you have a canonical
   message can be in common for all.</li>
<li>The merkle tree for Chainpoint itself is fairly basic, Peter Todd’s open
   timestamps uses a more sophisticated merkle tree. Should we do a
   Chainpoint 3.0?</li>
<li>Specific to open-timestamps on Bitcoin, it uses a different method to
   store the merkle tree root that may be more acceptable long-term than
   op_return.</li>
<li>Open-timestamp offers some additional services — should we start defining
   APIs?</li>
<li>Peter Todd has had some success to with open-timestamps and PGP for use
   with Github commit signatures. Should we try to get this to be a standard
   as well?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="json-normalized-clear-text-signatures">JSON Normalized Clear Text Signatures</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515">JSON Web Signatures</a> (JWS)
specification defines how one may perform digital signatures on a block of
JSON data. While ideal for a number of use cases that require digital
signatures, the approach is not a good fit for other use cases that require
digital signatures. For example, data signed using JWS, called
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JSON Web Tokens</a> (JWT), are base-64
encoded. This creates a number of problems for developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>JWTs cannot be natively stored in document-based storage engines (like
   MongoDB and CouchDB) without decoding them, which removes the digital
   signature information</li>
<li>JWTs cannot be nested within each other easily, requiring multiple nested
   base-64 encodings with duplicated data to support nested signatures</li>
<li>JWTs do not easily support multi-signature schemes, meaning that they can't
   be chained together without duplicating the data for each chained signature</li>
<li>JWTs are not JSON, which most developers expect when publishing, consuming,
   and working with data. While it's true that you can base-64 decode the
   data, you then lose the signature and have to track it through some other
   means if the signed object in question needs to be transmitted to a remote
   system.</li>
<li>You cannot express Linked Data in a syntax-agnostic way and are forced to
   create a signature on a JSON-LD document, which binds the signature to the
   JSON-LD syntax rather than making the signature more syntax agnostic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linked Data Signatures were originally designed to sign Linked Data and
overcome the shortcomings of JWTs above. There have been several requests over
the years to support clear JSON signatures, resulting in a signature block
that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>"signature": {
   "type": "JsonSignature2017",
   "created": "2017-01-02T12:11:54Z",
   "creator": "https://example.org/keys/123",
   "domain": "example.com",
   "nonce": "ba9e0b95",
   "signatureValue": "IKwTuQqTwz...IEBAE3sLgs="
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Doing so requires a new JSON Normalization Algorithm specification and a
Signature Suite with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>canonicalizationAlgorithm - https://w3id.org/security#JNA2017 which needs
   to be defined.</li>
<li>digestAlgorithm - https://w3id.org/security#sha256 defined in
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234">RFC6234</a></li>
<li>signatureAlgorithm - http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1
   defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447">RFC3447</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few open questions that need to be discussed at
Rebooting Web of Trust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this normalization mechanism desired by participants in the Workshop?</li>
<li>Is there a pre-existing JSON normalization algorithm that we should use as
   the basis for the normalization specification?</li>
<li>The JOSE group strictly avoided JSON normalization, is there something we're
   missing in attempting to provide such a mechanism?</li>
<li>Which use cases would require the use of this signature suite instead of
   using the existing Linked Data Signature 2016 suite?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jwt-style-linked-data-signatures">JWT-style Linked Data Signatures</h2>
<p>It has also been postulated that JWT-style digital signatures could be
encapsulated in Linked Data Signatures producing a signature format that looks
like the following:</p>
<pre><code>"signature": {
    "type": "Jwt2017",
    "signatureValue":    "

  }
</code></pre>
<p>Doing so would require new JSON Normalization Algorithm specification and a
Signature Suite with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>canonicalizationAlgorithm - https://w3id.org/security#JWT2017 which needs
   to be defined.</li>
<li>digestAlgorithm - https://w3id.org/security#sha256 defined in

   defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447">RFC3447</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This would raise the following open questions that would need to be discussed
at Rebooting Web of Trust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the ability to embed JWTs in a Linked Data Signature block desirable?</li>
<li>Is the duplication of the entirety of the content in the signature desirable?</li>
<li>Which use cases would require the use of this signature suite instead of
   using the existing Linked Data Signature 2016 suite?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>In this paper, four extensions to the Linked Data Signatures specification
have been introduced. The authors of the paper would like to explore each
extension in more detail at the Rebooting Web of Trust III Workshop and
produce one or more W3C-formatted specifications that summarize the state of
findings during the course of the workshop.</p>
