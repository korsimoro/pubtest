    <h1 id="btcr-did-resolver-specification">BTCR DID Resolver Specification</h1>
<p>By: Kim Hamilton Duffy, Christopher Allen, Ryan Grant</p>
<p>This describes the process of resolving a BTCR DID into a DID Document. The draft reference implementation is available at https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/btcr-did-tools-js (see didFormatter.js). Note not all steps described in this document are implemented yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://weboftrustinfo.github.io/btcr-tx-playground.github.io/">See the BTCR playground</a> for a live demonstration. The BTCR playground uses the draft reference implementation BTCR DID resolver.</p>
<h2 id="input-btcr-did">Input: BTCR DID</h2>
<p>The input to a BTCR DID resolver is a BTCR DID. </p>
<pre><code>Format:  did:btcr:&lt;specific-idstring&gt;
Example: did:btcr:txtest1-xkyt-fzgq-qq87-xnhn
</code></pre>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The initial step of a BTCR DID resolver validates input by confirming <code>method</code> from the DID is <code>btcr</code>.</p>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Confirm <code>method</code> from the DID is <code>btcr</code>. Fail if not</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="resolution-phase-1-construct-implicit-did-document">Resolution Phase 1: Construct "implicit" DID document</h2>
<h3 id="goal_1">Goal</h3>
<p>This phase constructs the "implicit" DID Document from Bitcoin transactioh data</p>
<h3 id="steps_1">Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>From the BTCR DID, extract the transaction reference: this is the <code>&lt;specific-idstring&gt;</code> part of <code>did:btcr:&lt;specific-idstring&gt;</code> = <code>did:btcr:&lt;TXREF(TX0)&gt;</code></li>
<li>From the txref encoding, determine the transaction <ul>
<li>The txref prefix determines which Bitcoin network to use<ul>
<li>For example with <code>txtest1-xkyt-fzgq-qq87-xnhn</code>, <code>txtest1</code> is the Bitcoin testnet network, which means we consult the testnet network for the transaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The remainder of the txref-encoded transaction is an encoding of the block height and position</li>
<li>Reference implementation: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/txref-conversion-js</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look up transaction by height and position. Is the transaction output spent?<ul>
<li>no: this is the latest version of the DID. From this we can construct the DID Document</li>
<li>yes: keep following transaction chain until the latest with an unspent output is found</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extract the hex-encoded public key that signed the transaction and update the DID document with default authentication capability<ul>
<li>Populate the first entry of the <code>publicKey</code> array in the DID document. This uses the <a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-koblitz2016/">Koblitz Elliptic Curve Signature 2016</a> signature suite</li>
<li>Populate the first entry of the <code>authentication</code> array in the DID document, referencing the key above. </li>
<li>Note: It is a BTCR method convention that <code>#keys-1</code> corresponds to the transaction signing key. We'll see in the next spec that overriding this path in the supplementary DID document data is not allowed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the transaction contains an <code>OP_RETURN</code> field, populate the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> in the DID document. This is assumed to reference supplementary DID document data<ul>
<li>Add an entry to the <code>service</code> section of the DID document<ul>
<li><code>type</code> is <code>BTCREndpoint</code></li>
<li><code>serviceEndpoint</code> is the value in the OP_RETURN field, e.g. "https://github.com/myopreturnpointer"</li>
<li><code>timestamp</code> is XXX?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add <code>SatoshiAuditTrail</code>, which contains additional metadata available from the Bitcoin transaction. Note: needs details</li>
</ol>
<p>If the transaction contained no OP_RETURN data (and therefore no serviceEndpoint was added), the resolution process is done. Otherwise, proceed to the next phase.</p>
<h3 id="output-of-phase-1">Output of Phase 1</h3>
<p>The output of this resolution phase is referred to as the "implicit" DID Document; it is derived exclusively from Bitcoin transaction data.</p>
<p>If the transaction has no OP_RETURN data, then the <code>service</code> array would have no entries. The only default capabilities would be to authenticate with the transaction signing key.</p>

<ol>
<li>Retrieve the jsonld document from <code>serviceEndpoint.BTCREndpoint</code>, get first JSON type "DID Document". TODO<ul>
<li>If URL doesn't exist, ERROR</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Authenticate this JSON-LD fragment as valid<ul>
<li>Note: The DID <code>id</code> value is <em>not</em> required to be in this JSON-LD.<ul>
<li>If this patch data is an immutable file named by content hash (if stored in IPFS, for example) then it was committed before any blockchain confirmations occurred. </li>
<li>The DID <code>id</code> value for an immutable DID document patch must be implicitly constructed by the method resolver presenting the valid DID document.</li>
<li>Question: must it be present if not in an immutable store? I think yes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If BTCREndpoint is in immutable content hash (say ipfs), it is considered valid and no signature is required on this JSON, as in effect, it is signed by the blockchain transaction</li>
<li>Otherwise, the JSON-LD at the BTCREndpoint must have signature matching Bitcoin transaction signing key<ul>
<li>If not, ERROR</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: does this mean BTCR resolvers must know in advance a registry of immutable stores?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Merges in known JSON-LD values (additional keys, authorizations, etc) as appropriate into DID document. Additive only!<ul>
<li>Any fields that are part of the DID specification (<code>publicKey</code>, <code>authentication</code>, <code>service</code>) will be merged into the DID document by appending their entries to the arrays of the appropriate field</li>
<li>If continuation overwrites the Bitcoin key value, ERROR</li>
<li>Unknown JSON-LD values (in type "DID Document") are appended to the constructed DID Document</li>
<li>Non-DID JSON-LD data types that may also be at BTCEndpoint (such as Verifiable Claims) are ignored by resolver</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Loop for secondary (patch) DID Documents<ul>
<li>Get secondary (patch) DID Documents and merge according to step 8</li>
<li>Parse for secondary BTCREndpoint URL(s) TODO: what does this mean?</li>
<li>Questions: <ul>
<li>should we specify order? Depth first? </li>
<li>what to do with path collisions? i.e. 2 different DID patches use the path <code>#keys-2</code>?</li>
<li>Consider DoS limits of this loop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proposed: wrap the DID document in resolver envelope with additional metadata</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="output-of-phase-2">Output of Phase 2</h3>
<p>Returns final constructed JSON-LD DID Document to caller, which can use the keys to authenticate data such the signature on a verifiable claim, or perform other application tasks.</p>
<p>Let's assume the supplementary DID document (from the OP_RETURN data) is stored in an immutable store and contains the following <code>didDocument</code>. </p>
<pre><code>{
  ...
  &quot;didDocument&quot;: {
      &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;https://w3id.org/did/v1&quot;,
      &quot;publicKey&quot;: [{
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;#keys-2&quot;,
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;RsaVerificationKey2018&quot;,
        &quot;publicKeyPem&quot;: &quot;-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n&quot;
      }],
      &quot;authentication&quot;: [{
        // this key can be used to authenticate as DID ...fghi
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;RsaSignatureAuthentication2018&quot;,
        &quot;publicKey&quot;: &quot;#keys-2&quot;
      }],
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>id</code> is not known yet, because the transaction referencing this supplementary document has not occurred. </p>
<p>Then the final DID document would be:</p>

<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Content at BTCREndpoint has term separating out DID document "extensions".<ul>
<li>Under this are terms from DID specification.</li>
<li>Known BTCR terms will be spliced into e.g. "service", "authentication", etc</li>
<li>others will be included in DID returned by resolver</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>everything not under that node is not part of DID Document.<ul>
<li>claims</li>
<li>crypto-cats</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions-and-answers-from-january-2018-hackathon">Questions and Answers from January 2018 Hackathon</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to represent updates?<ul>
<li>Ryan claims that proofs about update are not proper for the DID document, other than to require methods to provide a way to do updates. Why should a client app need to know about updates? The DID spec should not try to provide a signed DID Document that is JSON-LD self-complete.  Instead, trust in the method resolver is needed. </li>
<li>Should this be part of the audit trail?  (Ryan thinks yes.  Any objections?)</li>
<li>At which layer is this happening? is it a requirement of the universal resolver? or is this simply returning info from which this can be determined? </li>
<li>This also means we can remove the following:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>      &quot;update&quot;: {[
        // update is implicit 
        // Optional: txout index
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;BTCRTip&quot;,
        &quot;serviceEndpoint&quot;: &quot;bitcoinaddress&quot;
      ]},
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>How to represent timestamp?</li>
<li>Some of the values (the DID ID itself, the bitcoin key, the BTREndpoint, and any immutable content hash items) are effectively timestamped by the Bitcoin transaction</li>
<li>However, mutable values from the DID Document construction process may have been updated later. </li>
<li>Should the BTCR spec demand that compliant method resolvers sign the returned DID Document (diddo), using a standard envelope?  (This, even though it's out of scope for the DID spec.)</li>
</ul>
