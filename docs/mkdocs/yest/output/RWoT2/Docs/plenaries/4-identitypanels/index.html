    <p><strong>GROUP 1</strong></p>
<p>Humancentric, for people not gov't
Human-oriented usability</p>
<p>We change our identity ship: so that it's owned by people, not gov't by the end</p>
<p>There will be multiple identity solutions, but there should be a common substrate
- We shouldn't touch reputation, because it's a third rail</p>
<p>There will be more smaller states in future</p>
<p><strong><em>Things That Will Help</em></strong>
- System of identity pointers that are self-sovereign
- Decentralized system of containers for identity
- Verifiable claims that can create strong n-dimensional links between entities</p>
<p><strong>GROUP 2</strong></p>
<p>Identity is expansive
- Used for more
- Might have multiple identity
- Has to be dynamic
- Could be multiple people with identities</p>
<p>There will be an <em>available</em> global UN ID
- But will not be most people's normal ID</p>
<p>Anonymity is a problem 
- Should be able to opt-out
- Blockchain can be troublesome for privacy due to future advances
- So even encrypted data should be stored off-chain</p>
<p><strong>GROUP 3</strong></p>
<p>We will be individuals or digital selves, not users
- We are participants, not consumers
- Organizations are not providers, they're identity consumers
- Reserve the right to opt-out and go dark</p>
<p>The gap of identity symmetry will be closed
- But there will need to be incentives</p>
<p>The main difference was what happens with the natural world: is it better or does it have like the digital world?</p>
<p>Gov't and organization recognizing identities they didn't create will be the big change: interoperability!</p>
<p><strong>GROUP 4</strong></p>
<p>Identification needs to become a process
Algorithmic Identity Bots will create identity under control of original source</p>
<p>A lot of difference over uses of biometric technologies</p>
<p>Is this really a tech set of challenges or humanistic?</p>
<p>Is this a problem about humans needing identity or a problem about machines needing identity?</p>
<p>Adoption will be driven by commercial adoption.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP 5</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Personas will be first-class identity. Identification is no longer required for authentication. People won't <em>need</em> to know who you are as a human to use services.</li>
<li>Informal reputation, based on attestations, will be more releavant than legal identity.</li>
<li>Keys and key management will be intuitive and under the control of an individual.</li>
<li>There will be dynamic webs of trust, which may help us find people with same attibutes.</li>
<li>Post offices will play a pivotal role. (Or maybe can do through reputation, not gov't.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>GROUP 6</strong></p>
<p>Hope to have definition of use cases
And what identity is
Need to define the minimal claim set</p>
<p>We need to talk to users to learn what identity is</p>
<p>Legal system needs to catch up with technology!
- Are we digital as human beings?</p>
<p>Biometrics once more the elephant in the room
- Believe they can be username, not password.</p>
<p>Need a user-centric system
- Needs to serve the needs of humans, not the gov't</p>
<p>Need a context-specific identity system</p>
<p><strong>GROUP 7</strong></p>
<p>Identities is a process, not a data structure
- Different needs for different situations</p>
<p>Self-sovereign Identity
- Digital selfie!
- Self issue identifier
- Ornaments (attributes) are what you attach
- If stolen, just reconstruct
- Some attributes not valid if not signed by related entity (e.g., MIT degree)</p>
<p>Biometrics switch over time</p>
