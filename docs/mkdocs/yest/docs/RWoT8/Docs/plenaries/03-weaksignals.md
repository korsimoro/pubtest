# Weak Signals

So far, we've discussed the strong signals, but there are also weak
signals that we want to raise up to the surface. 

We're doing this with an excercise:

It's 2040. You've just had a real good day. Something you've been
working on for the last 21 years in the field of digital identity has
finally come to a completion.

Later, you get a phone call from someone in the press reminding you
that it's the anniversary of something; what did you have to do with
it.

So, write up your story of what made your day in 2040 amazing.

## We Want to Live with Verifiable Credentials

But we really want _agency_, so that we can easily give authorization
to people, so that we can easily manage our data.

## Synchronic Identity vs. Dichronic Identity

Synchronic = government birth certificate. It says it's the same
individual.

Dichronic = different identities in different contexts for different
reasons.

We need to engineer for dichronic identity! So that we don't constrain
ourselves!

## Cool Tech is Not Enough

How does the advent of digital identity affect us?

Other ideas: being able to wipe an old identity; and not building
dystopian identity

## Getting Identity Systems to Work Together

But you have to step up a level, and talk about agent ecosystem, and
how you ensure that it works as intended.

## Freedom from Limitation

You should be able to choose to participate in a decentralized or
centralized system. You should be able to move between spaces.

## Digital Twins & Their Rights

The synthesized concepts:
* Need our actions to be seamless. 
* Need to think about ecological bottom line.
* Need to be able to verify content.

As we move into world of connected digital twin, we need different
rights and laws.

## Will This Technology Get to The Point Where We Can Ignore Tech Details?

Can this allow us to move past fiscal capitalism

## Can This Be Deployed in Balanced Fashion?

Privacy concerns vs Regulation

## The World is a Gigantic MMORPG

With each person a player in their own game.

## How Can the Digital World Better Reflect How We Think and Cooperate Natively?

How do we have human-centric goals and cooperate on them?

## Digital & Physical Merge

Augmented reality becomes the way that these two worlds communicate

## Social Key Recovery

Keeping private keys private and not losing them is a really hard problem!

## Poly-decentric

We can freely exit networks, but is there a corresponding right to
freely enter after having exited?

We need to formalize these rights!

A shared need for proactive goverrnance.

## Is There a Freedom to Exit Digital Society?

Autonomy & right-to-opt-out.

## Counter/revoke/delete Negative Credentials

Is there a way to counter bad credentials: a right to be forgiven?

## Being Able to Use Identities in the Real World

Having the legal right to have DID, not being forced to have a
government-identity.

## Oh My God! Quantum Computing Actually Works!

How to build a quantum-resistant DID

## Transcendence

Dealing with data beyond credentials, survivng chaos, going beyond
physical boundaries, and having agency

Unique ideas:
* Personal agents
* Unfettered human connections

## Different + Compatible Ideas

* Young people can make mistakes
* Shift in topology of communication could lead people back to countryside

# The Big Commonalities

Some things that emerged:

* Right to Forgiveness / Opt-Out
   * Look Backward to See Forward?
      * Branding and Scarlet Letter were old problems like this
* How Do We Have Dignity at Scale?
   * That is, how do we get rid of trolls online?
* How to Use DIDs and VCs for Humans to Cooperate?
* Agent Capabilities & Delegating Responsibilities
* Collective vs. Collaborative Intelligence
* Take Care & Think About What We're Doing
* Where Is the Locus of Control?
