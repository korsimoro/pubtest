    <h1 id="introduction-day-two">Introduction: Day Two</h1>
<p>Welcome to Day Two of RWOT8.</p>
<p>We begin with some far-ranging, casual discussion.</p>
<h2 id="white-space">White Space</h2>
<p>We had ahas in our white space of the dinner last night.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can change the "D" in CRUD for DIDs to Deactivate.</li>
<li>What does deactivation mean for Verifiable Claims?</li>
<li>For service endpoints?</li>
<li>We can better define what a DID is.</li>
<li>DIDs are the IP addresses of the identity layer</li>
<li>
<p>Verifiable Claims are the killer app, but what else might we see?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps peer-to-peer DIDs suggest there should be encrypted DID Documents, encrypted by the public key of the other peer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're very excited by illustrations for Joram, as we could really use help with our storytelling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're talking about interop, but we're not demonstrating it. Maybe we could demo some different stacks interoping at the next RWOT?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>We have a lot of discussion of terminology, and how we could improve
it, and what resources are already available.</p>
<p>Listing the disagreements over terminology is the first step!</p>
<h2 id="legal">Legal</h2>
<p>There was some discussion of the legal group, which was briefly
touched upon in a "cage match" session last night:</p>
<p>We are trying to see how to create governance at a global level,
without a government. But the code is our governance.</p>
<p>How can we come to a common agreement and still allow for variety?</p>
<p>Others would like to see an aspirational list and a problems
list. Before even a solutions list.</p>
<p>More generally: we need this cross-pollination from the legal folks if
we're going to be successful in what we're building.</p>
<p>Or perhaps: the ethics is where we should start, because it tells us
why we're doing what we're doing.</p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>Diversity continues to be an issue for us, but we work toward it at
every workshop.</p>
<p>And it's particularly important because we're creating identity
technology that everyone will be using.</p>
<p><em>And we're on to demos ...</em></p>
