# Topic Paper Report-Outs

## Group 1: Linked Data Capabilities

What is a capability?

A physical key is a capability

But wouldn't it be nice to have an electronic key, and put ability to
revoke on it, and have caveats?

And wouldn't it be nice to have a key that only worked for 12 months

   * Delegation
   * Attenuation

## Group 2: DID Auth & Pragmatics

DID AUTH. The moment when you prove you're still in control of your DID.

   * Needs feeback from people using verifiable claims

PRAGMATICS. We have been doing this for years, and not obviously
taking off on an exponential rise. We need to do something
different. A roadmap.

If something is not on full roadmap to adoption, users aren't seeing
the whole picture.

How do we grow the ecosystem without decentralization occurring from
someone nailing a feature and attracting everyone? (Email is a good
example! Chat providing is not!)

## Group 3: DIDs, Dads & Data; UBI

Lots of things discussed:

DIDs. Interoperability with what's currently available 

DADs. Distributed autonomic data. Makes decisions for you on your behalf.

DATA STORAGE on the Blockchain.

--

UBI. How to use cryptocurrency for basic currency

Technology open commons.

## Group 4: DID TLS & DID Volume

DID TLS. We want to get started on this; it'll take a while.

DID VOLUME. We have a procedural process that can run on any blockchain and solve
volume problem for creating DID. But you have to remove idea of
transferability.

## Group 5: Use Cases

How do you use the RWOT workshop?

When different use cases have different demands. Could need privacy or publicity.

What are the common patterns to use the data? To store the data?

There's a lack of clarity.

We should consider pushing on things that quickly go exponential.

## Group 6: DID Auth

How can we get DID auth out there and used quickly by corporations?

What is the path to get there?

Is TLS the right model to get there?

## Group 7: The Implementers Group

From British Columbia & Open Badges

British Columbia is ...

Working to bootstrap a self-sovereign system

Public, open credentials for businesses.

Created TheOrgBook, a central repository to place credentials

Overlaps with Badge world ...

Because with badges, you have questions of trust, where credentials are stored

## Group 8: Corporate Self-Sovereign Identity & PGP

CORP SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY. Why needed?

Beacause corporations cross sovereign boundaries!

PGP. Can we retire it?

BTRC is a more limited DID method focused on web of trust.

So what is a web of trust?

You are the root for a web of people that you trust!

And it links out from you to people you know to people they know.

This brings up question of PETNAMES (aka Local Names). How do you name these people as
they are further removed?
