<p>Authors: Bohdan Andriyiv (bohdan.andriyiv@validbook.org)</p>
<p>Keywords: short_topic_paper_to_open_discussion, PGP, Web of Trust, graph analysis</p>
<p>It appears, there is a widespread understanding that webs of trust do not work (based on twitter conversations, email discussions and even the name of this conference). </p>
<p>PGP's web of trust is often used as the classic example of WoT's inability to work in the real world. This way of thinking is usually taken unquestioned at the face value. I'd like to challenge it.</p>
<p>PGP's WoT actually works! </p>
<p>There is a confusion, - PGP's failure to be adopted by wide masses is confused with PGP's WoT failure (inability to work in real life). This is not true. PGP was not widely adopted because it is too difficult to use. For the most of the people PGP's benefit to privacy is not worth mental cost and inconvenience. But for all nerds (sorry:P) who are willing to put effort into using PGP, PGP and it's Web of Trust works!
This is especially true now, when PGP WoT is supported by popular social networks (posting PGP address on social profiles). </p>
<h2 id="questions-and-suggestions">Questions and suggestions:</h2>
<p>Discuss proofs that PGP WoT works / does not work / would not work if there were more incentives to break it.</p>
