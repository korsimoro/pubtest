# Weak Signals

## Team 1: A Medley

   * Privacy-respecting voice assistance
   * Women choose more personas naturally than men; how do we respect this?
   * Delegation in smart ways

   * Community-commons-authorized smart-weapon systems

## Team 2: Another Medley

   * DIDs Love & War
      * How used in romance and in wartime situations
   * DID Wallet Adoption
   * Where are the easy demos?
      * The low-hanging fruit
   * Protocol future-proofing best practices
   * Privacy-preserving biometric sybil attack prevention
   * Proof of Identity for blockchains

## Team 3: Intentions, Consent, and Other Topics

   * Modeling intention and consent
      * What security policies look like
      * How do we reason about it in computer & human systems
      * UI & UX
      * How do we make it usable to people
   * Incentive models
   * Smart contracts
   * Key revocation & DIDs
   * Manage policies across devices
   * Are Verifiable Credentials Compatible with Data That's Rapidly Changing?
      * (Model as instantaneous claims, not permanent ones.)

## Team 4: Three More Topics

   * The rise of cryptographic circuits
   * How do you get gov'ts to adopt faster?
      * The GPDR?
   * pre-active fraud detection for the DID environment
      * Creating an environment that keeps people on their toes!

## Team 5: Making it Real

Minimal viable implementation of everything we've been talking about.

Ideas:

   * Single sign-on with DIDs
   * Replacing DNS and SSL certificates in browser

Related: minimum viable community of people

What are the convincing stories and the convincing things that we build?

   * _Carrots_ (single sign-ons) & _sticks_ (Equifax)

To make it real, are there a lot more possibilities for key recovery
than we've thought of?

## Team 6: Proof of Individuality (& Voting Systems)

How do we build trusted voting systems with DIDs while maintaining
privacy?

   * No one knows who voted
   * But know that the right number of people voted

What would a reputation system look like in a decentralized system?

How do you verify that a person only has a single entity within the
system?

Can you build a proof-of-person consensus system within a
decentralized system?

There are _biometric_ solutions and _consensus_ solutions!
And possibly _implantable device_ solutions!

   * But there was a strangely strong reaction about embedding chips in our bodies

Once you have this guarantee, _what can you do with it?_

## Team 7: Identifiers Create Trust

Once we have identifiers for people and things we can push everything
out to the edges.

So suddenly a credit service is no longer needed to determine credit
scores! Something on the edge can do it.

## Team 8: Five Final Items

   * Building trust in community
   * Service discovery
      * What can you do with an identity?
   * Transparency about data usage
   * Network resilience
      * How much of identity is tied to specific parts of network that could collapse
   * How can we build a system that competes on privacy
