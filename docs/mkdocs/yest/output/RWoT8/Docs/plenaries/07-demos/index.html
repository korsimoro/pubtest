    <h1 id="demos">Demos</h1>
<h2 id="hie-of-one">HIE of One</h2>
<p>Making a standards-based self-sovereign identity stack.</p>
<p>Three components to code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Directory</li>
<li>Agent (UMA)
3.</li>
</ol>
<p>Want to show some features that connect to adoption and OpenConnect papers:</p>
<p>Once you have a self-sovereign agent, you can now decide whether to
whitelist an identity provider or whether you want to accept a
particular credential.</p>
<p>Creates a crossover between the federated world and the self-sovereign
world!</p>
<h2 id="simbol">SIMBOL</h2>
<p>Virtual realities want digital identities that move between them,
with all their objects.</p>
<p>SIMBOL is an identity system for VR. Allows portabililty between
virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Built on DIDs, with Verifiable Credentials. (But they're all invisible
to users: it should be simple!)</p>
<h2 id="verifiable-displays">Verifiable Displays</h2>
<p>Displaying Verifiable Credentials in HTML.</p>
<p>Want to be able to download Credential and be able to see it in
human-readable format and send it as attachment in email.</p>
<p>To do so: put credential in HTML, then HASH it, so can see if it was
tampered with.</p>
<h2 id="handshake">Handshake</h2>
<p>Decentralized naming (DNS) project, creating a Decentralied
Certificate Authority.</p>
<p>Embeds DNS root file in blockchain and then offers domains through
auctions.</p>
<p>Could be used to create human-readable names for DIDs, but is that
desireable?</p>
<h2 id="digital-trust-protocol">Digital Trust Protocol</h2>
<p>Creating a base layer of trust on the internet: extending human trust
system into digital space.</p>
<p>You trust peers, and that delegates trust, and their decisions now
affect you.</p>
<p>Integrated with Twitter, and allows autoblocking and automuting.</p>
<p>Protocol can be used on reedit, news articles, etc.</p>
<h2 id="rabobank-ssi-demo">Rabobank SSI Demo</h2>
<p>Identity wallet and SSI-as-a-service</p>
<p>Allows elegant retrieval and sharing of data.</p>
<h2 id="key-recovery-methodology">Key Recovery Methodology</h2>
<p>Split the seed using Shamir Secret Sharing</p>
<p>3 out of 5 can restore</p>
<p>Invitations are sent out with deep links using preferred communication apps.</p>
<p>Trust is created through six-digit verification code, which must be shared.</p>
<p>To ensure that data isn't lost, health status is sent routinely from
friend's devices.</p>
<h2 id="ipid">IPID</h2>
<p>IPID is publishing DID Document using IPLD.</p>
<p>Uses blockchain for independent validation of proof of existence.</p>
<p>Support human-readable name spaces</p>
<h2 id="identity-graph">Identity Graph</h2>
<p>Attention limits what our brain can do.</p>
<p>We can pull data from different groups and create clusters and
quantify the attention.</p>
<h2 id="meeco-wallet">Meeco Wallet</h2>
<p>Offering equity and value through data that is shared.</p>
<p>Enabling end-to-end use cases and making it simple to navigate.</p>
<p>Supports sharing of Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs with progressive disclosure</p>
<h2 id="identitycom">Identity.com</h2>
<p>Open-source community framework used by Civic; their tech is there and
available for others to use.</p>
<p>Presenting today: the Identity Validator Toolkit.</p>
<p>Show validations of credentials wallet.</p>
<h2 id="kilt-protocol">Kilt Protocol</h2>
<p>Create claims, request attestations, send them to issuers, who create
credentials.</p>
<p>Want to also model more complex trust structures.</p>
<h2 id="tno-ssi-why-are-we-doing-this">TNO â€” SSI: Why Are We Doing This?</h2>
<p>Enabling business transactions.</p>
<p>Current problems: </p>
<p>Users: people may not know what is asked or where to get
data to enable these transactions.</p>
<p>Businesses: don't know how to verify data.</p>
<p>Using SSI to make this all easier: a little robot can say how to fill
in form and where to get data and how to validate it.</p>
<h2 id="ixo">IXO</h2>
<p>Web of Trust for sustainable development.</p>
<p>Can connect with projects and make claims. Everything uses DIDs: the
people and the projects.</p>
<h2 id="split-identity-backup">Split Identity Backup</h2>
<p>Working on prototypes for an identity wallet. </p>
<p>Split Backup = Shamir Secret Sharing</p>
<p>A simpler name for use by people who aren't familiar with
cryptography!</p>
<p>Generate QR codes for key shares, then easily rebuilds identities by
scanning.</p>
<p>Part of Blockchain Commons: making what we're doing here real!</p>
<h2 id="id-pass-smartcard">ID PASS SmartCard</h2>
<p>ID PASS supports multiple identities and claims</p>
<p>Using smart cards to link to biometrics, but in a decentralized way</p>
<p>This is a real example of what was imagined in the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/final-documents/joram-engagement-model.pdf">Joram</a> use case produced just a few years ago. </p>
<p>Can save biometrics on card, can do signatures from card.</p>
