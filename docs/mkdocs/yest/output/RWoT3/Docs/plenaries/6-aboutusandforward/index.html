    <p>6-Day3morning-metaconversations</p>
<p><em>A short poll suggested some answers about who we are.</em></p>
<p><em>WHO ARE WE?</em>
   * Primarily from US, but 25 others
   * Primarily software developers, but 31% others
   * A quarter of us are entirely developed to identity
   * We want to Collaborate, Do the Work, and Ship It!</p>
<p><em>WHAT DO WE BELIEVE?</em>
   * We believe these technologies will have a huge impact on the world
   * We believe that we'll succeed in interesting ways, but with compromises
   * We are very satisfied with our participation in Web of Trust!</p>
<p><em>MOVING FORWARD</em>
   * We need to better daylight papers
   * We need to work with standards
   * Equal interest in every 6 or 12 months
   * We're interested in a more GLOBAL community, but it's expensive(!)
   * We want to communicate with Slack and Email</p>
<p><em>TACTICS</em></p>
<p>Some discussion on how to finalize papers.</p>
<p>But how do we publicize them better?</p>
<p><em>IP</em></p>
<p>Some question about patent rights and code IP, since our creative commons licenses have been focused on paper.</p>
<p><em>FRANCE</em></p>
<p>There was some discussion of getting space in France due to interest there </p>
