    <h1 id="what-we-learned-from-discussing-our-primers">What We Learned from Discussing Our Primers</h1>
<h2 id="functional-identity">Functional Identity</h2>
<p>Wants funtional identity to be a revolution that's afterward obvious.</p>
<p><strong>What We Learned New:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It's founded on a <em>subjective</em> perception of identity</li>
<li>It's not identity as a thing, but a <em>function</em>.</li>
<li>It's about enabling conversation and engineering.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other Peoples' Thoughts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It's about correlation: marries identity to verifiable claims.</li>
<li>Your identity only has value if it's useful is an old concept that bridges to functional identity</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</h2>
<p><strong>Main Issue Raised:</strong></p>
<p><em>Economics.</em> In order to have individual rights of self-sovereign-identity, there has to be social and technological infrastructure that can enforce and support rights! Laws, religious traditions, and even violence are all classic ways to enforce rights. But we have new ways to architect in digital age. </p>
<p>But, how are these technological infrastructures to be sustained? Traditionally, we have platform capitalism, where platform holds identity and generates revenue in some way. With blockchains, we have totally different incentives to incentivize the growth of the network. </p>
<p>There are no final answers to how to approach this problem, but the question of sustainability and economics and how digital rights will be protected and enforced is critical.</p>
<p><strong>Other Peoples' Thoughts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The crypto-economics of the web of trust might be a reframing of this topic.</li>
<li>Connections to GPDR are interesting, and how self-sovereign identity could help address these problems.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dids">DIDs</h2>
<p>The simple answer: Give a public key an address and put it on the blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest Themes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>There's not just one method for DIDs. Why not? Because there's not one blockchain, not one community!  They're all going to compete, they're different species, so survival of the fittest!</li>
<li>They're not such thing as a DID without decentralized key management.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other Peoples' Thoughts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>There's support for a universal resolver for resolving DID methods.</li>
<li>Zuko's Triangle: Can't have a single name that's human-meaningful, decentralized and secure, and globally-unique. Blockchains might close Zuko's Triangle, but DIDs are explicitly avoiding human-meaningful names to avoid economic contention over short names.</li>
<li>Interesting that there are DID methods coming in from outside the group.</li>
<li>There can be multiple methods on a blockchain or a method on multiple blockchains.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="verifiable-claims">Verifiable Claims</h2>
<p>Getting easier to explain and more people are coming to understand it.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest Takeaway:</strong></p>
<p>The human dynamic on creating credentials is the biggest question right now. It's a data-modeling vocabulary question that's susceptible to attack just from people not getting along.</p>
<p>Now that we're pushing it out, this human component is going to matter more and more and it might make things more difficult from here on out.</p>
<p><strong>Other Peoples' Thoughts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>People were reminded that data transfer requests can contain demand from user about how the data can be used: a user-generated terms of use! The open question is: can other side ignore or do they have to listen to this?</li>
<li>The current terminology can be confusing because "verifiable" could be confused between someone claiming something and the fact itself.</li>
</ol>
