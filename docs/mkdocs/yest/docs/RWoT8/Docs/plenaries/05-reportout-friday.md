# Initial Group Abstracts

## Incentivizing Decentralized Collaboration (Chris)

How do you incentivize beneficial collaboration

## Driving Adoption Based on Basic Human Needs (Sam)

User journeys. Safety and security are basic human needs. We need to
create win-win situations with VCs.

## Terminology

(Postponed decision for abstract and to write paper.)

## Satyrn (Joe) â€” CODE

Markdown file format with interactive code, teaching and testing
node.js modules.

## DID Spec Work (Manu)

* Triaging issues
* Splitting up into editorial work
* Continuing on refinement of spec
* Producing a work plan

## Universal Pluralism (Boris)

Can we create a global legal framework based on network of networks:
local frameworks that are interoperable.

## OSI/DID Interoperability

Reuse OpenConnect to prove ownership of a DID: describe how and why.

## DID Key Management in the Group

Examines specific requirements for DID on the web, plus limitations,
and how they apply to DID key management.

## Social key Recovery (Chris)

Two outputs planned:
1.  Low-hanging fruit for improvements to Shamir (CODE)
2. Survey of issues, opportunities, and risks for the future of social-key recovery beyond Shamir.

## Human-meaningful Names for SS-I 

Had a long discussion about whether human-meaningful names serve a
purpose. They're not technically necessary, but they might be nice.

Came up with a spec, but discovered that Blockstack had already done it!

(deciding whether to continue or not.)

General discussion: it's a hard, hard problem, but a good one. And
we'd like to have something that doesn't depend on one company.

Maybe talking about the history of it itself would be a good paper.

(A Pitfall Primer??)

## Bootstrapping an SS-I Framework

Though the tech has matured, bootstrapped an SS-I framework at scale
hasn't happened. This paper will outline paths to adoption.

US Health Care System use case.

## Framework to Assess Value of Self-Issued Credentials

How and when could they make sense? Principals?

1. Should be invested in by issuer.
2. Should be scarce.
3. Can be signed by others to increase assurances.

## Journalism Use Cases

Journalism as an industry-specific issuer.

## Verifiable Credential Test Corpus (Ryan)

A playground or museum.

We need a corpus of claims that can be tested for success or failure.

(There will be two abstracts for this, covering different areas.)

## JORAM Illustrations

Working on illustrations

## Peer-to-Peer DID Method Spec

Peer-to-peer without any public source of truth.

Method spec already created, now editing it.

## Establishing Trust Relation Between Verifier and Issuer, First Time (Matt)
