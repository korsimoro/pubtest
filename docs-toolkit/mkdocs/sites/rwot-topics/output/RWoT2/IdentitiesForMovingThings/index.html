<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Internet of Moving Things (IoMT) is a much more interesting area
of research than The Internet of Things (IoT).  Moving things
dynamically change context, and when they do, there is the
opportunity, or requirement, to perform a transaction.  These
transactions will become increasingly automated and will dramatically
affect areas such as Trade Finance.</p>
<p>Combining Physical Automation (IoT/IoMT) with Financial and
Transactional Automation (Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains) will
result in Economic Automation.  For instance, autonomous shipping
containers will negotiate their own transit, dynamically adjust their
insurance, validate their modes of transportation (Is this the right
ship?), and perform other operations without the need to involve
humans in-the-loop.</p>
<p>A key enabler to create this Economically Automated world will be the
ability for all of the parties involved, who are not going to be
humans, to be able to obtain and trust their respective identities.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>What does it mean to identify a thing?</p>
<p>Would there be different levels of identity for things?</p>
<p>Would identity expire?</p>
<p>How would identity be presented and verified?</p>
<p>Is there a physical manifestation of identity akin to biometrics?</p>
