<p><strong>Holder:</strong> Someone who possesses credentials, usually (but not always) the subject of the credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Hub:</strong> A datastore where objects are signed by a digital identity and accessible through unique global identifiers. See also <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/final-documents/hubs.pdf">"Hubs"</a> and <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/final-documents/identity-hub-attestations.pdf">"Identity Hub Attestation Flows and Components"</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Identifier:</strong> A proxy for identity that's used as a label to refer to the entity. For example, a name or UID.</p>
<p><strong>Identity:</strong> A somewhat nebulous term, defined in different ways by different people. Broadly, it's who or what an entity is.</p>
<p><strong>Identity, Digital:</strong> A digital representation of identity.</p>
<p><strong>Identity, Functional:</strong> A model for identity that says, "Identity is how we keep track of people and things and, in turn, how they keep track of us." See also <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">"A Primer on Functional Identity"</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Issuer:</strong> Someone who asserts claims and issues them in credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Key:</strong> A cryptographic secret used to encrypt or decrypt data. In traditional symmetric cryptography, the same key was used for encrypting and decrypting. In public-key cryptography, a private key is used for encrypting (and signing) while a mathematically related public key is used for decrypting (and verifying).</p>
<p><strong>PGP:</strong> <em>Pretty Good Privacy.</em> A classic program used for encrypting, decrypting, and signing data. The origin of the Web of Trust, which was designed as a method for determining the trust of public keys, as an alternative to a centralized public-key infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>PKI:</strong> <em>Public-Key Infrastructure.</em> A methodology to ensure the creation, storage, distribution, and revocation of public keys.</p>
<p><strong>Private Key:</strong> Half of the keypair in public-key cryptography. A secret that's used to encrypt and to sign.</p>
<p><strong>Public Key:</strong> Half of the keypair in public-key cryptography. A publicly distributed key that's used to decrypt and to verify signatures.</p>
<p><strong>Public-key Cryptography:</strong> A cryptographic process that uses two mathematically related keys, one to encrypt a message and one to decrypt a message; one key (the public key) can be derived from the other key (the private key), but not vice-versa.</p>
<p><strong>Repository:</strong> A wallet (or other storage area) used to store personal credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Reputation:</strong> A system for measuring the behavior of entities.</p>
<p><strong>Revocation:</strong> The act of cancelling digital identity data such as a DID or private key.</p>
<p><strong>Ripple:</strong> A real-time payment and settlement system designed to bridge transfers between different sorts of money using the XRP cryptocurrency. Although it uses a distributed consensus ledger, it is not a blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Selective Disclosure:</strong> A method of sharing information at a granular level, such as revealing some claims but not an entire credential. See also <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/final-documents/data-minimization-sd.pdf">"Engineering Privacy for Verified Credentials"</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Signature:</strong> A means for verifying the authenticity of a message or transaction by signing it with a private key; the signature can then be verified with a public key.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Contract:</strong> A digital program, often associated with the transaction of cryptocurrency funds. Neither smart nor a contract.</p>
<p><strong>SSI:</strong> <em>Self-sovereign identity.</em> A decentralized, portable digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority.

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Someone who is the subject of claims.</p>
<p><strong>Trustless:</strong> Requiring no trust. A process that is designed such that its rules ensure that all of its participants must act fairly. Usually part of a decentralized design.</p>
<p><strong>Verifiable Claims:</strong> The original name for Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Verifiable Credentials:</strong> A tamper-evident credential, per the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">W3C Data Model</a>. See also <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/verifiable-credentials-primer.md">"A Verifiable Credentials Primer"</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verification:</strong> The act of proving the accuracy of something, often verifying a digital signature.</p>
<p><strong>Verifier:</strong> Someone who verifies credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet:</strong> A digital means to store private keys and their associated public keys. The term comes from cryptocurrency wallets, which store the keys associated with cryptocurrency transactions, but there are also identity wallets, which store keys related to digital identities.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet, Hardware:</strong> A hardware gadget that acts as a wallet. Often, a Ledger or a Trezor.</p>
<p><strong>Web of Trust:</strong> A method for assessing trust based on peer-to-peer processes. More broadly, an area of digital development that focuses on decentralized identity.</p>
<p><strong>XRP:</strong> Currently, the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, owned by Ripple. Created as a high-speed bridge currency that eliminates exchange fees.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-knowledge Proof:</strong> A cryptographic method where someone can prove that they know some information without revealing the information.</p>
